<h3>ACT I</h3>


<h4>TABLEAU I</h4>

<p class="center sc">The Double Life</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><i>The Stage represents a room in the Deacon&rsquo;s house, furnished partly
as a sitting-, partly as a bed-room, in the style of an easy burgess of
about 1780. C., a door; L.C., second and smaller door; R.C., practicable
window; L., alcove, supposed to contain bed; at the back,
a clothes-press and a corner cupboard containing bottles, etc.</i></p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mary Brodie</span> at needlework; <span class="sc">Old Brodie</span>, a paralytic, in wheeled

</div>

<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<p class="ct"><i>To these, <span class="sc">Leslie</span>, C.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> May I come in, Mary?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> I scarce knew where to find you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> The dad and I must have a corner, must we not?
So when my brother&rsquo;s friends are in the parlour he
allows us to sit in his room. &rsquo;Tis a great favour, I
can tell you; the place is sacred.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Are you sure that &ldquo;sacred&rdquo; is strong enough?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> You are satirical!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> I? And with regard to the Deacon? Believe
me, I am not so ill-advised. You have trained me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>6</span>
well, and I feel by him as solemnly as a true-born
Brodie.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> And now you are impertinent! Do you mean
to go any further? We are a fighting race, we Brodies.
O, you may laugh, sir! But &rsquo;tis no child&rsquo;s play to
jest us on our Deacon, or, for that matter, on our
Deacon&rsquo;s chamber either. It was his father&rsquo;s before
him: he works in it by day and sleeps in it by night;
and scarce anything it contains but is the labour of
his hands. Do you see this table, Walter? He made
it while he was yet a &rsquo;prentice. I remember how I
used to sit and watch him at his work. It would
be grand, I thought, to be able to do as he did, and
handle edge-tools without cutting my fingers, and
getting my ears pulled for a meddlesome minx! He
used to give me his mallet to keep and his nails to
hold; and didn&rsquo;t I fly when he called for them! and
wasn&rsquo;t I proud to be ordered about with them! And
then, you know, there is the tall cabinet yonder;
that it was that proved him the first of Edinburgh
joiners, and worthy to be their Deacon and their
head. And the father&rsquo;s chair, and the sister&rsquo;s work-box,
and the dear dead mother&rsquo;s footstool&mdash;what are
they all but proofs of the Deacon&rsquo;s skill, and tokens
of the Deacon&rsquo;s care for those about him?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> I am all penitence. Forgive me this last time,
and I promise you I never will again.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Candidly, now, do you think you deserve forgiveness?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Candidly, I do not.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Then I suppose you must have it. What have
you done with Willie and my uncle?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> I left them talking deeply. The dear old Procurator
has not much thought just now for anything
but those mysterious burglaries&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> I know!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Still, all of him that is not magistrate and official
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>7</span>
is politician and citizen; and he has been striving
his hardest to undermine the Deacon&rsquo;s principles, and
win the Deacon&rsquo;s vote and interest.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> They are worth having, are they not?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> The Procurator seems to think that having
them makes the difference between winning and
losing.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Did he say so? You may rely upon it that he
knows. There are not many in Edinburgh who can
match with our Will.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> There shall be as many as you please, and not
one more.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> How I should like to have heard you! What
did uncle say? Did he speak of the Town Council
again? Did he tell Will what a wonderful Bailie
he would make? O, why did you come away?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> I could not pretend to listen any longer. The
election is months off yet; and if it were not&mdash;if it
were tramping up-stairs this moment&mdash;drums, flags,
cockades, guineas, candidates, and all!&mdash;how should
I care for it? What are Whig and Tory to me?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> O, fie on you! It is for every man to concern
himself in the common weal. Mr. Leslie&mdash;Leslie of
the Craig!&mdash;should know that much at least.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> And be a politician like the Deacon! All in good
time, but not now. I hearkened while I could, and
when I could no more I slipped out and followed my
heart. I hoped I should be welcome.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> I suppose you mean to be unkind.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Tit for tat. Did you not ask me why I came
away? And is it usual for a young lady to say &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo;
to the man she means to marry?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> That is for the young lady to decide, sir.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> And against that judgment there shall be no
appeal?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> O, if you mean to argue!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> I do not mean to argue. I am content to love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>8</span>
and be loved. I think I am the happiest man in the
world.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> That is as it should be; for I am the happiest
girl.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Why not say the happiest wife? I have your
word, and you have mine. Is not that enough?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Have you so soon forgotten? Did I not tell you
how it must be as my brother wills? I can do only
as he bids me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Then you have not spoken as you promised?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> I have been too happy to speak.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> I am his friend. Precious as you are, he will
trust you to me. He has but to know how I love you,
Mary, and how your life is all in your love of me,
to give us his blessing with a full heart.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> I am sure of him. It is that which makes my
happiness complete. Even to our marriage I should
find it hard to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; when he said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Your father is trying to speak. I&rsquo;ll wager he
echoes you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary</span> (<i>to <span class="sc">Old Brodie</span></i>). My poor dearie! Do you want
to say anything to me? No? Is it to Mr. Leslie,
then?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> I am listening, Mr. Brodie.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> What is it, daddie?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Old Brodie.</span> My son&mdash;the Deacon&mdash;Deacon Brodie&mdash;the
first at school.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> I know it, Mr. Brodie. Was I not the last in the
same class? (<i>To <span class="sc">Mary</span>.</i>) But he seems to have
forgotten us.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> O, yes! his mind is wellnigh gone. He will sit
for hours as you see him, and never speak nor stir
but at the touch of Will&rsquo;s hand or the sound of Will&rsquo;s
name.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> It is so good to sit beside you. By and by
it will always be like this. You will not let me speak
to the Deacon? You are fast set upon speaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>9</span>
yourself? I could be so eloquent, Mary&mdash;I would
touch him. I cannot tell you how I fear to trust my
happiness to any one else&mdash;even to you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> He must hear of my good fortune from none but
me. And, besides, you do not understand. We are
not like other families, we Brodies. We are so clannish,
we hold so close together.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> You Brodies, and your Deacon!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Old Brodie.</span> Deacon of his craft, sir&mdash;Deacon of the
Wrights&mdash;my son! If his mother&mdash;his mother&mdash;had
but lived to see!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> You hear how he runs on. A word about my
brother and he catches it. &rsquo;Tis as if he were awake
in his poor blind way to all the Deacon&rsquo;s care for
him and all the Deacon&rsquo;s kindness to me. I believe
he only lives in the thought of the Deacon. There,
it is not so long since I was one with him. But indeed
I think we are all Deacon-mad, we Brodies.&mdash;Are
we not, daddie dear?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>without, and entering</i>). You are a mighty magistrate,
Procurator, but you seem to have met your
match.</p>

<h4>SCENE II</h4>

<p class="ct"><i>To these, <span class="sc">Brodie</span> and <span class="sc">Lawson</span></i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary</span> (<i>curtseying</i>). So, uncle! you have honoured us
at last.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> <i>Quam primum</i>, my dear, <i>quam primum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Well, father, do you know me? (<i>He sits beside
his father, and takes his hand.</i>)</p>

<p>(<span class="sc">Old Brodie.</span> William&mdash;ay&mdash;Deacon. Greater man&mdash;than&mdash;his
father.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> You see, Procurator, the news is as fresh to
him as it was five years ago. He was struck down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>10</span>
before he got the Deaconship, and lives his lost life
in mine.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Ay, I mind. He was aye ettling after a bit
handle to his name. He was kind of hurt when first
they made me Procurator.)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> And what have you been talking of?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Just o&rsquo; thae robberies, Mary. Baith as a burgher
and a Crown offeecial, I tak&rsquo; the maist absorbing
interest in thae robberies.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Egad, Procurator, and so do I.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>with a quick look at <span class="sc">Leslie</span></i>). A dilettante interest,
doubtless! See what it is to be idle.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> &rsquo;Faith, Brodie, I hardly know how to style it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> At any rate, &rsquo;tis not the interest of a victim, or
we should certainly have known of it before; nor
a practical tool-mongering interest, like my own;
nor an interest professional and official, like the Procurator&rsquo;s.
You can answer for that, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> I think I can; if for no more. It&rsquo;s an interest
of my own, you see, and is best described as indescribable,
and of no manner of moment to anybody. (It
will take no hurt if we put off its discussion till a month
of Sundays.)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> You are more fortunate than you deserve.
What do you say, Procurator?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Ay is he! There&rsquo;s no&rsquo; a house in Edinburgh
safe. The law is clean helpless, clean helpless! A
week syne it was auld Andra Simpson&rsquo;s in the Lawn-market.
Then, naething would set the catamarans
but to forgather privily wi&rsquo; the Provost&rsquo;s ain butler,
and tak&rsquo; unto themselves the Provost&rsquo;s ain plate.
And the day, information was laid down before me
offeecially that the limmers had made infraction,
<i>vi et clam</i>, into Leddy Mar&rsquo;get Dalziel&rsquo;s, and left her
leddyship wi&rsquo; no&rsquo; sae muckle&rsquo;s a spune to sup her
parritch wi&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s unbelievable, it&rsquo;s awful, it&rsquo;s anti-christian!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>11</span>
<span class="sc">Mary.</span> If you only knew them, uncle, what an example
you would make! But, tell me, is it not strange
that men should dare such things, in the midst of
a city, and nothing, nothing be known of them&mdash;nothing
at all?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Little, indeed! But we do know that there
are several in the gang, and that one at least is an
unrivalled workman.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Ye&rsquo;re right, sir; ye&rsquo;re vera right, Mr. Leslie.
It had been deponed to me offeecially that no&rsquo; a tradesman&mdash;no&rsquo;
the Deacon here himsel&rsquo;&mdash;could have made
a cleaner job wi&rsquo; Andra Simpson&rsquo;s shutters. And as
for the lock o&rsquo; the bank&mdash;but that&rsquo;s an auld
sang.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I think you believe too much, Procurator.
Rumour&rsquo;s an ignorant jade, I tell you. I&rsquo;ve had
occasion to see some little of their handiwork&mdash;broken
cabinets, broken shutters, broken doors&mdash;and I find
them bunglers. Why, I could do it better myself.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Gad, Brodie, you and I might go into partnership.
I back myself to watch outside, and I suppose
you could do the work of skill within?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> An opposition company? Leslie, your mind
is full of good things. Suppose we begin to-night,
and give the Procurator&rsquo;s house the honours of our
innocence?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> You could do anything, you two!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Onyway, Deacon, ye&rsquo;d put your ill-gotten
gains to a right use; they might come by the wind,
but they wouldna gang wi&rsquo; the water; and that&rsquo;s aye
a <i>solatium</i>, as we say. If I am to be robbit, I would
like to be robbit wi&rsquo; decent folk; and no&rsquo; think o&rsquo;
my bonnie clean siller dirling among jads and dicers.
<span class="correction" title="removed parenthesis">&rsquo;Faith,</span> William, the mair I think on&rsquo;t, the mair I&rsquo;m
o&rsquo; Mr. Leslie&rsquo;s mind. Come the night, or come the
morn, and I&rsquo;se gie ye my free permission, and lend
ye a hand in at the window forbye!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>12</span>
<span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Come, come, Procurator, lead not our poor clay
into temptation. (<i><span class="sc">Leslie</span> and <span class="sc">Mary</span> talk apart.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> I&rsquo;m no muckle afraid for your puir clay, as
ye ca&rsquo;t. But hark i&rsquo; your ear: ye&rsquo;re likely, joking
apart, to be gey and sune in partnership wi&rsquo; Mr. Leslie.
He and Mary are gey and pack, a&rsquo;body can see that.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> &ldquo;Daffin, and want o&rsquo; wit&rdquo;&mdash;you know the rest.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> <i>Vidi, scivi, et audivi</i>, as we say in a Sasine,
William.) Man, because my wig&rsquo;s pouthered do you
think I havena a green heart? I was aince a lad
mysel&rsquo;, and I ken fine by the glint o&rsquo; the e&rsquo;e when a
lad&rsquo;s fain and a lassie&rsquo;s willing. And, man, it&rsquo;s the
town&rsquo;s talk; <i>communis error fit jus</i>, ye ken.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Old Brodie.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> See, ye&rsquo;re hurting your faither&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Dear dad, it is not good to have an ill-tempered
son.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> What the deevil ails ye at the match? &rsquo;Od
man, he has a nice bit divot o&rsquo; Fife corn-land, I can
tell ye, and some Bordeaux wine in his cellar! But
I needna speak o&rsquo; the Bordeaux; ye&rsquo;ll ken the smack
o&rsquo;t as weel&rsquo;s I do mysel&rsquo;; onyway it&rsquo;s grand wine.
<i>Tantum et tale.</i> I tell ye the <i>pro&rsquo;s</i>, find you the <i>con.&rsquo;s</i>,
if ye&rsquo;re able.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> (I am sorry, Procurator, but I must be short
with you.) You are talking in the air, as lawyers
will. I prefer to drop the subject (and it will displease
me if you return to it in my hearing).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> At four o&rsquo;clock to-morrow? At my house? (<i>To
<span class="sc">Mary</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> As soon as church is done. (<i>Exit <span class="sc">Mary</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Ye needna be sae high and mighty, onyway.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I ask your pardon, Procurator. But we Brodies&mdash;you
know our failings! (A bad temper and a humour
of privacy.)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Weel, I maun be about my business. But I
could tak&rsquo; a doch-an-dorach, William; <i>superflua non
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>13</span>
nocent</i>, as we say; an extra dram hurts naebody,
Mr. Leslie.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>with bottle and glasses</i>). Here&rsquo;s your old friend,
Procurator. Help yourself, Leslie. O no, thank you,
not any for me. You strong people have the advantage
of me there. With my attacks, you know, I must
always live a bit of a hermit&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> &rsquo;Od, man, that&rsquo;s fine; that&rsquo;s health o&rsquo; mind
and body. Mr. Leslie, here&rsquo;s to you, sir. &rsquo;Od, it&rsquo;s

Ha, it is! (<i>At the mirror.</i>) In that case George&rsquo;s
mother bids him bind his hair. (<i>Kisses his hand.</i>)
My dearest Duchess&mdash;&mdash;(<i>To <span class="sc">Jean</span>.</i>) I say, Jean,
there&rsquo;s a good deal of difference between this sort of
thing and the way we does it in Libberton&rsquo;s Wynd.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> I daursay. And what wad ye expeck?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Ah, Jean, if you&rsquo;d cast affection&rsquo;s glance on this
poor but honest soger! George Lord S. is not the
nobleman to cut the object of his flame before the
giddy throng; nor to keep her boxed up in an old
mouse-trap, while he himself is revelling in purple
splendours like these. He didn&rsquo;t know you, Jean:
he was afraid to. Do you call that a man? Try a
man that is.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> The Deacon&rsquo;s old man! Well, he couldn&rsquo;t expect
to have his quiver full of sich, could he, Jean? (<i>To
<span class="sc">Old Brodie</span>.</i>) Ah, my Christian soldier, if you had,
the world would have been more variegated. Mrs.
Deakin (<i>to <span class="sc">Jean</span></i>), let me introduce you to your dear

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> Think shame to yoursel&rsquo;! This is the Deacon&rsquo;s

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> The Fiscal? He don&rsquo;t count.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> What d&rsquo;ye mean?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Well, Deakin, since Fiscal Lawson&rsquo;s Nunkey
Lawson, and it&rsquo;s all in the family way, I don&rsquo;t mind
telling you that Nunkey Lawson&rsquo;s a customer of
George&rsquo;s. We give Nunkey Lawson a good deal of
brandy&mdash;G. S. and Co.&rsquo;s celebrated Nantz.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> What! does he buy that smuggled trash of
yours?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Well, we don&rsquo;t call it smuggled in the trade,
Deakin. It&rsquo;s a wink and King George&rsquo;s picter between
G. S. and the Nunks.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Gad! that&rsquo;s worth knowing. O Procurator,
Procurator, is there no such thing as virtue? (<i>Allons!</i>
It&rsquo;s enough to cure a man of vice for this world and
the other.) But hark you hither, Smith; this is all
damned well in its way, but it don&rsquo;t explain what
brings you here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>18</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> I&rsquo;ve trapped a pigeon for you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Can&rsquo;t you pluck him yourself?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Not me. He&rsquo;s too flash in the feather for a
simple nobleman like George Lord Smith. It&rsquo;s the
great Capting Starlight, fresh in from York. (He&rsquo;s
exercised his noble art all the way from here to London.
&ldquo;Stand and deliver, stap my vitals!&rdquo;) And the
North Road is no bad lay, Deakin.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Flush?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith</span> (<i>mimicking</i>). &ldquo;Three graziers, split me! A mail,
stap my vitals! and seven demned farmers, by the
Lard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> By Gad!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Good for trade, ain&rsquo;t it? And we thought, Deakin,
the Badger and me, that coins being ever on the vanish,
and you not over sweet on them there lovely little
locks at Leslie&rsquo;s, and them there bigger and uglier
marine stores at the Excise Office....</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>impassible</i>). Go on.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Worse luck!... We thought, me and the
Badger, you know, that maybe you&rsquo;d like to exercise
your <i>h</i>elbow with our free and galliant horseman.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> The old move, I presume? The double set of
dice?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> That&rsquo;s the rig, Deakin. What you drop on the
square you pick up again on the cross. (Just as
you did with G. S. and Co.&rsquo;s own agent and correspondent,
the Admiral from Nantz.) You always
was a neat hand with the bones, Deakin.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> The usual terms, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> The old discount, Deakin. Ten in the pound for
you, and the rest for your jolly companions every one.
(<i>That&rsquo;s</i> the way <i>we</i> does it!)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Who has the dice?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Our mutual friend, the Candleworm.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> You mean Ainslie?&mdash;We trust that creature too
much, Geordie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>19</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> He&rsquo;s all right, Marquis. He wouldn&rsquo;t lay a finger
on his own mother. Why, he&rsquo;s no more guile in him
than a set of sheep&rsquo;s trotters.</p>

<p>(<span class="sc">Brodie.</span> You think so? Then see he don&rsquo;t cheat you
over the dice, and give you light for loaded. See
to that George, see to that; and you may count the
Captain as bare as his last grazier.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> The Black Flag for ever! George&rsquo;ll trot him
round to Mother Clarke&rsquo;s in two twos.) How long&rsquo;ll
you be?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> The time to lock up and go to bed, and I&rsquo;ll be
with you. Can you find your way out?</p>

I have something to tell you. If you knew how happy
I am, you would clap your hands, Will. But come, sit
you down there, and be my good big brother, and I will
kneel here and take your hand. We must keep close
to dad, and then he will feel happiness in the air. The
poor old love, if we could only tell him. But I sometimes
think his heart has gone to heaven already, and
takes a part in all our joys and sorrows; and it is only
his poor body that remains here, helpless and ignorant.
Come, Will, sit you down, and ask me questions&mdash;or
guess&mdash;that will be better, guess.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Not to-night, Mary; not to-night. I have other

glad. But to-night it cannot be.</p>

pretty sister, if you please, with something to tell,
which she would not tell you for the world, and would
give the world to have you guess, and you won&rsquo;t?&mdash;Not
you! For business! Fie, Deacon Brodie! But
I&rsquo;m too happy to find fault with you!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> &ldquo;And me a Deacon,&rdquo; as the Procurator would
say.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> No such thing, sir! I am not a bit afraid of you&mdash;nor
a bit angry neither. Give me a kiss, and promise
me hours and hours to-morrow morning?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> All day long to-morrow, if you like.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Business or none?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Business or none, little sister! I&rsquo;ll make time,
I promise you; and there&rsquo;s another kiss for surety.
Come along. (<i>They proceed to push out the chair, L.C.</i>)
The wine and wisdom of this evening have given me one
of my headaches, and I&rsquo;m in haste for bed. You&rsquo;ll be
good, won&rsquo;t you, and see they make no noise, and let
me sleep my fill to-morrow morning till I wake?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Poor Will! How selfish I must have seemed!
You should have told me sooner, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have
worried you. Come along. (<i>She goes out, pushing
chair.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Now for one of the Deacon&rsquo;s headaches! Rogues
all, rogues all! (<i>Goes to clothes-press and proceeds
to change his coat.</i>) On with the new coat and into the
new life! Down with the Deacon and up with the
robber! (<i>Changing neck-band and ruffles.</i>) Eh God!
how still the house is! There&rsquo;s something in hypocrisy
after all. If we were as good as we seem, what would
the world be? (The city has its vizard on, and we&mdash;at
night we are our naked selves. Trysts are keeping,
bottles cracking, knives are stripping; and here is
Deacon Brodie flaming forth the man of men he is!)&mdash;How
still it is!... My father and Mary&mdash;Well!
the day for them, the night for me; the grimy cynical
night that makes all cats grey, and all honesties of one
complexion. Shall a man not have <i>half</i> a life of his
own?&mdash;not eight hours out of twenty-four? (Eight
shall he have should he dare the pit of Tophet.) (<i>Takes
out money.</i>) Where&rsquo;s the blunt? I must be cool
to-night, or ... steady, Deacon, you must win;
damn you, you must! You must win back the dowry
that you&rsquo;ve stolen, and marry your sister, and pay
your debts, and gull the world a little longer! (<i>As
he blows out the lights.</i>) The Deacon&rsquo;s going to bed&mdash;the
poor sick Deacon! <i>Allons!</i> (<i>Throws up the window
and looks out.</i>) Only the stars to see me! (<i>Addressing
the bed.</i>) Lie there, Deacon! sleep and be well
to-morrow. As for me, I&rsquo;m a man once more till
morning. (<i>Gets out of the window.</i>)</p>

<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Lawson, Hunt</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson</span> (<i>entering</i>). Step your way in, Officer. (<i>At wing.</i>)
Mr. Carfrae, give a chair to yon decent wife that cam&rsquo;
in wi&rsquo; me. Nae news?</p>

<p><span class="sc">A Voice without.</span> Naething, sir.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson</span> (<i>sitting</i>). Weel, Officer, and what can I do for
you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Well, sir, as I was saying, I&rsquo;ve an English warrant
for the apprehension of one Jemmy Rivers, <i>alias</i>
Captain Starlight, now at large within your jurisdiction.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> That&rsquo;ll be the highwayman?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> That same, Mr. Procurator-Fiscal. The Captain&rsquo;s
given me a hard hunt of it this time. I dropped
on his marks at Huntingdon, but he was away North,
and I had to up and after him. I heard of him all
along the York road, for he&rsquo;s a light hand on the pad,
has Jemmy, and leaves his mark. I missed him at
York by four-and-twenty hours, and lost him for as
much more. Then I picked him up again at Carlisle,
and we made a race of it for the Border; but he&rsquo;d a
better nag, and was best up in the road; so I had to
wait till I ran him to earth in Edinburgh here and
could get a new warrant. So here I am, sir. They
told me you were an active sort of gentleman, and I&rsquo;m
an active man myself. And Sir John Fielding, Mr.
Procurator-Fiscal, he&rsquo;s an active gentleman likewise,
though he&rsquo;s blind as a <i>h</i>image, and he desired his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>23</span>
compliments to you (sir, and said that between us he
thought we&rsquo;d do the trick).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Ay, he&rsquo;ll be a fine man, Sir John. Hand me
owre your papers, Hunt, and you&rsquo;ll have your new
warrant <i>quam primum</i>. And see here, Hunt, ye&rsquo;ll
aiblins have a while to yoursel&rsquo;, and an active man,
as ye say ye are, should aye be grinding grist. We&rsquo;re
sair forfeuchen wi&rsquo; our burglaries. <i>Non constat de personâ.</i>
We canna get a grip o&rsquo; the delinquents. Here
is the <i>Hue and Cry</i>. Ye see there is a guid two hundred
pounds for ye.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Well, Mr. Procurator-Fiscal (I ain&rsquo;t a rich man,
and two hundred&rsquo;s two hundred. Thereby, sir), I
don&rsquo;t mind telling you I&rsquo;ve had a bit of a worry at
it already. You see, Mr. Procurator-Fiscal, I had to
look into a ken to-night about the Captain, and an
old cock always likes to be sure of his walk; so I got
one of your Scots officers&mdash;him as was so polite as
to show me round to Mr. Brodie&rsquo;s&mdash;to give me full
particulars about the &rsquo;ouse, and the flash companions
that use it. In his list I drop on the names of two
old lambs of my own; and I put it to you, Mr. Procurator-Fiscal,
as a gentleman as knows the world,
if what&rsquo;s a black sheep in London is likely or not to be
keeping school in Edinburgh?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> <i>Coelum non animum.</i> A just observe.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> I&rsquo;ll give it a thought, sir, and see if I can&rsquo;t kill
two birds with one stone. Talking of which, Mr.
Procurator-Fiscal, I&rsquo;d like to have a bit of a confab
with that nice young woman as came to pay her rent.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Hunt, that&rsquo;s a very decent woman.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> And a very decent woman may have mighty queer
pals, Mr. Procurator-Fiscal. Lord love you, sir, I
don&rsquo;t know what the profession would do without
&rsquo;em!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Ye&rsquo;re vera richt, Hunt. An active and a watchful
officer, I&rsquo;ll send her in till ye.</p>

<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE II</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt</span> (<i>solus</i>). Two hundred pounds reward. Curious
thing. One burglary after another, and these Scots
blockheads without a man to show for it. Jock runs
east, and Sawney cuts west; everything&rsquo;s at a deadlock
and they go on calling themselves thief-catchers!
(By Jingo, I&rsquo;ll show them how we do it down South!
Well, I&rsquo;ve worn out a good deal of saddle-leather over
Jemmy Rivers; but here&rsquo;s for new breeches if you
like.) Let&rsquo;s have another queer at the list. (<i>Reads.</i>)
&ldquo;Humphrey Moore, otherwise Badger; aged forty,
thick-set, dark, close-cropped; has been a prize-fighter;
no apparent occupation.&rdquo; Badger&rsquo;s an old
friend of mine. &ldquo;George Smith, otherwise the Dook,
otherwise Jingling Geordie; red-haired and curly,
slight, flash; an old thimble-rig; has been a stroller;
suspected of smuggling; an associate of loose women.&rdquo;
G. S., Esquire, is another of my flock. &ldquo;Andrew
Ainslie, otherwise Slink Ainslie; aged thirty-five;
thin, white-faced, lank-haired; no occupation; has
been in trouble for reset of theft and subornation of
youth; might be useful as King&rsquo;s evidence.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s
an acquaintance to make. &ldquo;Jock Hamilton otherwise
Sweepie,&rdquo; and so on. (&ldquo;Willie M&rsquo;Glashan,&rdquo; hum&mdash;yes,
and so on, and so on.) Ha! here&rsquo;s the man
I want. &ldquo;William Brodie, Deacon of the Wrights,
about thirty; tall, slim, dark; wears his own hair;
is often at Clarke&rsquo;s, but seemingly for purposes of
amusement only; (is nephew to the Procurator-Fiscal;
is commercially sound, but has of late (it is supposed)
been short of cash; has lost much at cock-fighting;)
is proud, clever, of good repute, but is fond of adventures
and secrecy, and keeps low company.&rdquo; Now,
here&rsquo;s what I ask myself: here&rsquo;s this list of the family
party that drop into Mother Clarke&rsquo;s; it&rsquo;s been in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>25</span>
hands of these nincompoops for weeks, and I&rsquo;m the first
to cry Queer Street! Two well-known cracksmen,
Badger and the Dook! why, there&rsquo;s Jack in the
Orchard at once. This here topsawyer work they talk
about, of course that&rsquo;s a chalk above Badger and the
Dook. But how about our Mohock-tradesman? &ldquo;Purposes
of amusement!&rdquo; What next? Deacon of the
Wrights? and Wright in their damned lingo means a
kind of carpenter, I fancy? Why, damme, it&rsquo;s the
man&rsquo;s trade! I&rsquo;ll look you up, Mr. William Brodie,
Deacon of the Wrights. As sure as my name&rsquo;s Jerry
Hunt, I wouldn&rsquo;t take one-ninety-nine in gold for my
chance of that &rsquo;ere two hundred!</p>

<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE III</h4>

<p class="ct"><i><span class="sc">Hunt</span>; to him, <span class="sc">Jean</span></i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Well, my dear, and how about your gentleman
friend now? How about Deacon Brodie?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> I dinna ken your name, sir, nor yet whae ye are;
but this is a very poor employ for ony gentleman&mdash;it
sets ill wi&rsquo; ony gentleman to cast my shame in my
teeth.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Lord love you, my dear, that ain&rsquo;t my line of
country. Suppose you&rsquo;re not married and churched a
hundred thousand times, what odds to Jerry Hunt?
Jerry, my Pamela Prue, is a cove as might be your
parent; a cove renowned for the ladies&rsquo; friend (and
he&rsquo;s dead certain to be on your side). What I can&rsquo;t
get over is this: here&rsquo;s this Mr. Deacon Brodie doing
the genteel at home, and leaving a nice young &rsquo;oman
like you&mdash;as a cove may say&mdash;to take it out on cold
potatoes. That&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t get over, Mrs. Watt.
I&rsquo;m a family man myself; and I can&rsquo;t get over it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> And whae said that to ye? They lee&rsquo;d whatever.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>26</span>
I get naething but guid by him; and I had nae richt
to gang to his house; and O, I just ken I&rsquo;ve been the
ruin of him!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Don&rsquo;t you take on, Mrs. Watt. Why, now I
hear you piping up for him, I begin to think a lot
of him myself. I like a cove to be open-handed and
free.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> Weel, sir, and he&rsquo;s a&rsquo; that.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Well, that shows what a wicked world this is.
Why, they told me&mdash;&mdash;. Well, well, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the
open &rsquo;and and the &rsquo;appy &rsquo;art.&rdquo; And how much, my
dear&mdash;speaking as a family man&mdash;now, how much
might your gentleman friend stand you in the course
of a year?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> What&rsquo;s your wull?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> That&rsquo;s a mighty fancy shawl, Mrs. Watt. (I
should like to take its next-door neighbour to Mrs.
Hunt in King Street, Common Garden.) What&rsquo;s about
the figure?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> It&rsquo;s paid for. Ye can sweir to that.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Yes, my dear, and so is King George&rsquo;s crown; but
I don&rsquo;t know what it cost, and I don&rsquo;t know where the
blunt came from to pay for it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> I&rsquo;m thinking ye&rsquo;ll be a vera clever gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> So I am, my dear; and I like you none the worse
for being artful yourself. But between friends now,
and speaking as a family man&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> I&rsquo;ll be wishin&rsquo; ye a fine nicht. (<i>Curtsies and goes
out.</i>)</p>

<h4>SCENE IV</h4>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Hunt</span> (<i>solus</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Ah! that&rsquo;s it, is it? &ldquo;My fancy man&rsquo;s my &rsquo;ole
delight,&rdquo; as we say in Bow Street. But which <i>is</i>
the fancy man? George the Dook, or William the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>27</span>
Deacon? One or both? (<i>He winks solemnly.</i>) Well,
Jerry, my boy, here&rsquo;s your work cut out for you;
but if you took one-nine-five for that ere little two
hundred you&rsquo;d be a disgrace to the profession.</p>

<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> You&rsquo;ve got the devil&rsquo;s own luck, Deacon, that&rsquo;s
what you&rsquo;ve got.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Luck! Don&rsquo;t talk of luck to a man like me!
Why not say I&rsquo;ve the devil&rsquo;s own judgment? Men
of my stamp don&rsquo;t risk&mdash;they plan, Badger; they
plan, and leave chance to such cattle as you (and
Jingling Geordie. They make opportunities before
they take them).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> You&rsquo;re artful, ain&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Should I be here else? When I leave my house
I leave an <i>alibi</i> behind me. I&rsquo;m ill&mdash;ill with a jumping
headache, and the fiend&rsquo;s own temper. I&rsquo;m sick in bed
this minute, and they&rsquo;re all going about with the fear
of death on them lest they should disturb the poor sick
Deacon. (My bedroom door is barred and bolted like
the bank&mdash;you remember!&mdash;and all the while the
window&rsquo;s open, and the Deacon&rsquo;s over the hills and far
away. What do you think of me?)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>28</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> I&rsquo;ve seen your sort before, I have.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Not you. As for Leslie&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> That was a nick above you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Ay was it. He wellnigh took me red-handed;
and that was better luck than I deserved. If I&rsquo;d not
been drunk and in my tantrums, you&rsquo;d never have got
my hand within a thousand years of such a job.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Why not? You&rsquo;re the King of the Cracksmen,
ain&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Why not! He asks me why not! Gods
what a brain it is! Hark ye, Badger, it&rsquo;s all very
well to be King of the Cracksmen, as you call it;
but however respectable he may have the misfortune
to be, one&rsquo;s friend is one&rsquo;s friend, and as such must
be severely let alone. What! shall there be no
more honour among thieves than there is honesty
among politicians? Why, man, if under heaven
there were but one poor lock unpicked, and that
the lock of one whose claret you&rsquo;ve drunk, and who
has babbled of woman across your own mahogany&mdash;that
lock, sir, were entirely sacred. Sacred as the
Kirk of Scotland; sacred as King George upon his
throne; sacred as the memory of Bruce and Bannockburn.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> O, rot! I ain&rsquo;t a parson, I ain&rsquo;t; I never had
no college education. Business is business. That&rsquo;s
wot&rsquo;s the matter with me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Ay, so we said when you lost that fight with
Newcastle Jemmy, and sent us home all poor men.
That was a nick above <i>you</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Newcastle Jemmy! Muck: that&rsquo;s my opinion
of him: muck. I&rsquo;ll mop the floor up with him any
day, if so be as you or any on &rsquo;em &rsquo;ll make it worth
my while. If not, muck! That&rsquo;s my motto. Wot
I now ses is, about that &rsquo;ere crib at Leslie&rsquo;s, wos I
right, I ses? or wos I wrong? That&rsquo;s wot&rsquo;s the
matter with you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>29</span>
<span class="sc">Brodie.</span> You are both right and wrong. You dared
me to do it. I was drunk; I was upon my mettle;
and I as good as did it. More than that, blackguardly
as it was, I enjoyed the doing. He is my friend.
He had dined with me that day, and I felt like a
man in a story. I climbed his wall, I crawled along
his pantry roof, I mounted his window-sill. That
one turn of my wrist&mdash;you know it!&mdash;and the casement
was open. It was as dark as the pit, and I thought
I&rsquo;d won my wager, when, phewt! down went something
inside, and down went somebody with it. I
made one leap, and was off like a rocket. It was
my poor friend in person; and if he&rsquo;d caught and
passed me on to the watchman under the window, I
should have felt no viler rogue than I feel just now.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> I s&rsquo;pose he knows you pretty well by this time?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> &rsquo;Tis the worst of friendship. Here, Kirsty, fill
these glasses. Moore, here&rsquo;s better luck&mdash;and a more
honourable plant!&mdash;next time.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Deacon, I looks towards you. But it looks
thundering like rotten eggs, don&rsquo;t <span class="correction" title="originally ends with quotes">it?</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I think not. I was masked, for one thing,
and for another I was as quick as lightning. He
suspects me so little that he dined with me this very
afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Anyway, you ain&rsquo;t game to try it on again,
I&rsquo;ll lay odds on that. Once bit, twice shy. That&rsquo;s
your motto.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Right again. I&rsquo;ll put my <i>alibi</i> to a better use.
And, Badger, one word in your ear: there&rsquo;s no Newcastle
Jemmy about <i>me</i>. Drop the subject, and for
good, or I shall drop you. (<i>He rises, and walks backwards
and forwards, a little unsteadily; then returns,
and sits, L., as before.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Look here, Deacon, I mean business, I do.
(<i><span class="sc">Hunt</span> looks up at the name of &ldquo;Deacon.&rdquo;</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Gad, Badger, I never meet you that you do not.
(You have a set of the most commercial intentions!)
You make me blush.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> That&rsquo;s all blazing fine, that is! But wot I ses
is, wot about the chips? That&rsquo;s what I ses. I&rsquo;m
after that thundering old Excise Office, I am. That&rsquo;s
my motto.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> &rsquo;Tis a very good motto, and at your lips, Badger,
it kind of warms my heart. But it&rsquo;s not mine.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Muck! why not?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> &rsquo;Tis too big and too dangerous. I shirk King
George; he has a fat pocket, but he has a long arm.
(You pilfer sixpence from him, and it&rsquo;s three hundred
reward for you, and a hue and cry from Tophet to

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> All right. I can wait.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>seeing <span class="sc">Hunt</span></i>). Ha, a new face&mdash;and with a

dearly as a new face with a patch.) Who the devil,
sir, are you that own it? And where did you get
it? And how much will you take for it second-hand?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Well, sir, to tell you the truth&mdash;(<i><span class="sc">Brodie</span> bows</i>)&mdash;it&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>31</span>
not for sale. But it&rsquo;s my own, and I&rsquo;ll drink

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> An Englishman, too! Badger, behold a countryman.
What are you, and what part of southern
Scotland do you come from?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Well, your honour, to tell you the honest truth&mdash;&mdash;</p>

Embrace me, at a distance. (A patter-cove from

<h4>SCENE III</h4>

<p class="ct"><i>To these, <span class="sc">Smith</span>, <span class="sc">Rivers</span></i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Where&rsquo;s my beloved? Deakin, my beauty,
where are you? Come to the arms of George, and
let him introduce you. Capting Starlight Rivers!
Capting, the Deakin: Deakin, the Capting. An
English nobleman on the grand tour, to open his
mind, by the Lard!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rivers.</span> Stupendiously pleased to make your acquaintance,
Mr. Deaking, split me!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> We don&rsquo;t often see England&rsquo;s heroes our way,
Captain, but when we do, we make them infernally
welcome.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rivers.</span> Prettily put, sink me! (A demned genteel
sentiment, stap my vitals!)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> O Captain! you flatter me. (We Scotsmen
have our qualities, I suppose, but we are but rough and
ready at the best. There&rsquo;s nothing like your Englishman
for genuine distinction. He is nearer France
than we are, and smells of his neighbourhood. That
d&mdash;&mdash;d thing, the <i>je ne sais quoi</i>, too! Lard, Lard,
split me! stap my vitals! O such manners are
pure, pure, pure. They are, by the shade of Claude
Duval!)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rivers.</span> Mr. Deakin, Mr. Deakin (this is passatively too
much). What will you sip? Give it the <i>h</i>anar of a
neam.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> By these most <i>h</i>anarable hands now, Captain,
you shall not. On such an occasion I could play
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>33</span>
host with Lucifer himself. Here, Clarke, Mother
Midnight! Down with you, Captain (<i>forcing him
boisterously into a chair</i>). I don&rsquo;t know if you can
lie, but, sink me! you shall sit. (<i>Drinking, etc., in
dumb-show.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore</span> (<i>aside to <span class="sc">Smith</span></i>). We&rsquo;ve nobbled him, Geordie!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith</span> (<i>aside to <span class="sc">Moore</span></i>). As neat as ninepence! He&rsquo;s
taking it down like mother&rsquo;s milk. But there&rsquo;ll be
wigs on the green to-morrow, Badger! It&rsquo;ll be twopence
and toddle with George Smith.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> O, muck! Who&rsquo;s afraid of him? (<i>To <span class="sc">Ainslie</span>.</i>)
Hang on, Slinkie.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt</span> (<i>who is feigning drunkenness, and has overheard;
aside</i>). By Jingo!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rivers.</span> Will you sneeze, Mr. Deakin, sir?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Thanks; I have all the vices, Captain. You
must send me some of your rappee. It is passatively
perfect.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rivers.</span> Mr. Deakin, I do myself the <i>h</i>anar of a sip to you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Topsy-turvy with the can!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore</span> (<i>aside to <span class="sc">Smith</span></i>). That made him wink.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Your high and mighty hand, my Captain! Shall
we dice&mdash;dice&mdash;dice? (<i>Dumb-show between them.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie</span> (<i>aside to <span class="sc">Moore</span></i>). I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> What&rsquo;s up now?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie.</span> I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; to gie him the coggit dice?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> The square ones, rot you! Ain&rsquo;t he got to lose
every brass farden?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie.</span> What&rsquo;ll like be my share?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> You mucking well leave that to me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rivers.</span> Well, Mr. Deakin, if you passatively will have
me shake a <i>h</i>elbow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Where are the bones, Ainslie? Where are
the dice, Lord George? (<i><span class="sc">Ainslie</span> gives the dice and
dice-box to <span class="sc">Brodie</span>; and privately a second pair of dice.</i>)
Old Fortune&rsquo;s counters; the bonnie money-catching,
money-breeding bones! Hark to their dry music!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34">34</a></span>
Scotland against England! Sit round, you tame devils,
and put your coins on me!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Easy does it, my lord of high degree! Keep cool.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Cool&rsquo;s the word, Captain&mdash;a cool twenty on the
first?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rivers.</span> Done and done. (<i>They play.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt</span> (<i>aside to <span class="sc">Moore</span>, a little drunk</i>). Ain&rsquo;t that &rsquo;ere
Scots gentleman, your friend, too drunk to play, sir?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> You hold your jaw; that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter
with you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie.</span> He&rsquo;s waur nor he looks. He&rsquo;s knockit the
box aff the table.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith</span> (<i>picking up box</i>). That&rsquo;s the way <i>we</i> does it. Ten
to one and no takers!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Deuces again! More liquor, Mother Clarke!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Hooray, our side! (<i>Pouring out.</i>) George and
his pal for ever!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Deuces again, by heaven! Another?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rivers.</span> Done!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Ten more; money&rsquo;s made to go. On with you!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rivers.</span> Sixes.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Deuce-ace. Death and judgment! Double or
quits?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rivers.</span> Drive on! Sixes.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Fire away, brave boys. (<i>To <span class="sc">Moore</span>.</i>) It&rsquo;s Tally-ho-the-Grinder,
Hump!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Treys! Death and the pit! How much have
you got there?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rivers.</span> A cool forty-five.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I play you thrice the lot.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rivers.</span> Who&rsquo;s afraid?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Stand by, Badger!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rivers.</span> Cinq-ace.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> My turn now.  (<i>He juggles in and uses the
second pair of dice.</i>) Aces!  Aces again! What&rsquo;s
this? (<i>Picking up dice.</i>) Sold!... You play false,
you hound!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>35</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Rivers.</span> You lie!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> In your teeth. (<i>Overturns table, and goes for him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Here, none o&rsquo; that. (<i>They hold him back. Struggle.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Hold on, Deacon!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Let me go. Hands off, I say! I&rsquo;ll not touch
him. (<i>Stands weighing dice in his hand.</i>) But as
for that thieving whinger, Ainslie, I&rsquo;ll cut his throat
between this dark and to-morrow&rsquo;s. To the bone.
(<i>Addressing the company.</i>) Rogues, rogues, rogues!
(<i>Singing without.</i>) Ha! what&rsquo;s that?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie.</span> It&rsquo;s the psalm-singing up by at the Holy Weaver&rsquo;s.
And, O Deacon, if ye&rsquo;re a Christian man&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>solus</i>). My head! my head! It&rsquo;s the sickness of
the grave. And those bells go on!... go on ... inexorable
as death and judgment. (There they
go; the trumpets of respectability, sounding encouragement
to the world to do and spare not, and not to be
found out. Found out! And to those who are they
toll as when a man goes to the gallows.) Turn where
I will are pitfalls hell-deep. Mary and her dowry;
Jean and her child&mdash;my child; the dirty scoundrel
Moore; my uncle and his trust; perhaps the man
from Bow Street. Debt, vice, cruelty, dishonour,
crime; the whole canting, lying, double-dealing,
beastly business! &ldquo;My son the Deacon&mdash;Deacon of
the Wrights!&rdquo; My thoughts sicken at it. (O, the
Deacon, the Deacon! Where&rsquo;s a hat for the Deacon,

<p class="ct"><i>To him, <span class="sc">Jean</span>, a baby in her shawl, C.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean</span> (<i>who has entered silently during the Deacon&rsquo;s last
words</i>). It&rsquo;s me, Wullie.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>turning upon her</i>). What! You here again?
(you again!)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> Deacon, I&rsquo;m unco vexed.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Do you know what you do? Do you know
what you risk? (Is there nothing&mdash;nothing!&mdash;will
make you spare me this idiotic, wanton persecution?)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> I was wrong to come yestreen; I ken that fine.
But the day it&rsquo;s different; I but to come the day,
Deacon, though I ken fine it&rsquo;s the Sabbath, and I
think shame to be seen upon the streets.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> See here, Jean. You must go now. I&rsquo;ll come to
you to-night; I swear that. But now I&rsquo;m for the road.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> No&rsquo; till you&rsquo;ve heard me, William Brodie. Do
ye think I came to pleasure mysel&rsquo;, where I&rsquo;m no&rsquo;
wanted? I&rsquo;ve a pride o&rsquo; my ain.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Jean, I am going now. If you please to stay
on alone, in this house of mine, where I wish I could
say you are welcome, stay. (<i>Going.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> It&rsquo;s the man frae Bow Street.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Bow Street?</p>

sae muckle o&rsquo; William Brodie ... ill as it sets
me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> (You don&rsquo;t know what is on my mind, Jennie,
else you would forgive me.) Bow Street?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> It&rsquo;s the man Hunt: him that was here yestreen
for the Fiscal.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Hunt?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> He kens a hantle. He.... Ye maunna be
angered wi&rsquo; me, Wullie! I said what I shouldna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>38</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Said? Said what?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> Just that ye were a guid frien&rsquo; to me. He made
believe he was awfu&rsquo; sorry for me, because ye gied me
nae siller; and I said, &ldquo;Wha tellt him that?&rdquo; and
that he lee&rsquo;d.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> God knows he did! What next?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> He was that soft-spoken, butter wouldna melt
in his mouth; and he keept aye harp, harpin&rsquo;; but
after that let-out, he got neither black nor white
frae me. Just that ae word and nae mair; and at
the hinder end he just speired straucht out, whaur it
was ye got your siller frae.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Where I got my siller?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> Ay, that was it. &ldquo;You ken,&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Did he? and what said you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> I couldna think on naething, but just that he
was a gey and clever gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> You should have said I was in trade, and had
a good business. That&rsquo;s what you should have said.
That&rsquo;s what you would have said had you been worth
your salt. But it&rsquo;s blunder, blunder, outside and in
(upstairs, down-stairs, and in my lady&rsquo;s chamber).
You women! Did he see Smith?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> Ay, and kennt him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Damnation!&mdash;&mdash;No, I&rsquo;m not angry with you,
but you see what I&rsquo;ve to endure for you. Don&rsquo;t
cry. (Here&rsquo;s the devil at the door, and we must
bar him out as best we can.)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> God&rsquo;s truth, ye are nae vexed wi&rsquo; me?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> God&rsquo;s truth, I am grateful to you. How is the
child? Well? That&rsquo;s right. (<i>Peeping.</i>) Poor wee
laddie! He&rsquo;s like you, Jean.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> I thocht he was liker you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Is he? Perhaps he is. Ah, Jeannie, you must
see and make him a better man than his father.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> Eh man, Deacon, the proud wumman I&rsquo;ll be gin
he&rsquo;s only half sae guid.</p>

And now; go&mdash;go&mdash;go.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson</span> (<i>without L.</i>). I ken the way, I ken the way.</p>

<h4>SCENE III</h4>

<p class="ct"><i>To these, <span class="sc">Lawson</span>, L.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> A braw day this, William. (<i>Seeing <span class="sc">Jean</span>.</i>) Eh.
Mistress Watt? And what&rsquo;ll have brocht you here?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>seated on bench</i>). Something, uncle, she lost last
night, and she thinks that something she lost is here.
<i>Voilà.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Why are ye no&rsquo; at the kirk, woman? Do ye
gang to the kirk?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> I&rsquo;m mebbe no&rsquo; what ye would just ca&rsquo; reg&rsquo;lar. Ye
see, Fiscal, it&rsquo;s the wean.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> A bairn&rsquo;s an excuse; I ken that fine, Mistress
Watt. But bairn or nane, my woman, ye should be
at the kirk. Awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo; ye! Hear to the bells; they&rsquo;re
ringing in. (<i><span class="sc">Jean</span> curtsies to both, and goes out C.

<h4>SCENE IV</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson</span> (<i>to <span class="sc">Brodie</span>, returning C. from door</i>). <i>Mulier
formosa superne</i>, William: a braw lass and a decent
woman forbye.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I&rsquo;m no judge, Procurator, but I&rsquo;ll take your
word for it. Is she not a tenant of yours?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Ay, ay; a bit house on my land in Libberton&rsquo;s
Wynd. Her man&rsquo;s awa, puir body; or they tell me
sae; and I&rsquo;m concerned for her (she&rsquo;s unco bonnie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>40</span>
to be left her lane). But it sets me brawly to be
finding faut wi&rsquo; the puir lass, and me an elder, and
should be at the plate. (There&rsquo;ll be twa words about
this in the Kirk Session.) However, it&rsquo;s nane of my
business that brings me, or I should tak&rsquo; the mair
shame to mysel.&rsquo; Na, sir, it&rsquo;s for you; it&rsquo;s your
business keeps me frae the kirk.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> My business, Procurator? I rejoice to see it
in such excellent hands.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Ye see, it&rsquo;s this way. I had a crack wi&rsquo; the
laddie Leslie, <i>inter pocula</i> (he took a stirrup-cup wi&rsquo;
me), and he tells me he has askit Mary, and she was
to speak to ye hersel&rsquo;. O, ye needna look sae gash.
Did she speak? and what&rsquo;ll you have said to her?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> She has not spoken; I have said nothing; and
I believe I asked you to avoid the subject.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Ay, I made a note o&rsquo; that observation, William
(and assoilzied mysel&rsquo;). Mary&rsquo;s a guid lass, and I&rsquo;m
her uncle, and I&rsquo;m here to be answered. Is it to be
ay or no?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> It&rsquo;s to be no. This marriage must be quashed;
and hark ye, Procurator, you must help me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Me? ye&rsquo;re daft! And what for why?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Because I&rsquo;ve spent the trust-money, and I
can&rsquo;t refund it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Ye reprobate deevil!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Have a care, Procurator. No wry words!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Do you say it to my face, sir? Dod, sir, I&rsquo;m
the Crown Prosecutor.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Right. The Prosecutor for the Crown. And
where did you get your brandy?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Eh?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Your brandy!  Your brandy, man! Where
do you get your brandy? And you a Crown official
and an elder!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Whaur the deevil did ye hear that?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Rogues all! Rogues all, Procurator!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>41</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Ay, ay. Lord save us! Guidsake, to think
o&rsquo; that noo!... Can ye give me some o&rsquo; that Cognac?
I&rsquo;m ... I&rsquo;m sort o&rsquo; shaken, William, I&rsquo;m
sort o&rsquo; shaken. Thank you, William! (<i>Looking
piteously at glass.</i>) <i>Nunc est bibendum.</i> (<i>Drinks.</i>)
Troth, I&rsquo;m set ajee a bit. Wha the deevil tauld ye?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Ask no questions, brother. We are a pair.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Pair, indeed! Pair, William Brodie! Upon
my saul, sir, ye&rsquo;re a brazen-faced man that durst
say it to my face! Tak&rsquo; you care, my bonnie young
man, that your craig doesna feel the wecht o&rsquo; your
hurdies. Keep the plainstanes side o&rsquo; the gallows.
<i>Via trita, via tuta</i>, William Brodie!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> And the brandy, Procurator? and the brandy?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Ay ... weel ... be&rsquo;t sae! Let the
brandy bide, man, let the brandy bide! But for you and
the trust-money ... damned! It&rsquo;s felony. <i>Tutor
in rem suam</i>, ye ken, <i>tutor in rem suam</i>. But O man,
Deacon, whaur is the siller?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> It&rsquo;s gone&mdash;O how the devil should I know?
But it&rsquo;ll never come back.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Dear, dear! A&rsquo; gone to the winds o&rsquo; heaven!
Sae ye&rsquo;re an extravagant dog, too. <i>Prodigus et furiosus!</i>
And that puir lass&mdash;eh, Deacon, man, that puir lass!
I mind her such a bonnie bairn.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>stopping his ears</i>). Brandy, brandy, brandy,
brandy, brandy!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> William Brodie, mony&rsquo;s the long day that
I&rsquo;ve believed in you; prood, prood was I to be the
Deacon&rsquo;s uncle; and a sore hearing have I had of
it the day. That&rsquo;s past; that&rsquo;s past like Flodden
Field; it&rsquo;s an auld sang noo, and I&rsquo;m an aulder man
than when I crossed your door. But mark ye this&mdash;mark
ye this, William Brodie, I may be no&rsquo; sae guid&rsquo;s
I should be; but there&rsquo;s no&rsquo; a saul between the east
sea and the wast can lift his een to God that made
him, and say I wranged him as ye wrang that lassie.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>42</span>
I bless God, William Brodie&mdash;ay, though he was like
my brother&mdash;I bless God that he that got ye has the
hand of death upon his hearing, and can win into his
grave a happier man than me. And ye speak to me,
sir? Think shame&mdash;think shame upon your heart!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Rogues all!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> You&rsquo;re the son of my sister, William Brodie.
Mair than that I stop not to inquire. If the siller
is spent, and the honour tint&mdash;Lord help us, and the
honour tint!&mdash;sae be it, I maun bow the head. Ruin
shallna come by me. Na, and I&rsquo;ll say mair, William;
we have a&rsquo; our weary sins upon our backs, and maybe
I have mair than mony. But, man, if ye could
bring <i>half</i> the jointure ... (<i>potius quam pereas</i>) ... for
your mither&rsquo;s son? Na? You couldna
bring the half? Weel, weel, it&rsquo;s a sair heart I have
this day, a sair heart and a weary. If I were a better
man mysel&rsquo; ... but there, there, it&rsquo;s a sair
heart that I have gotten. And the Lord kens I&rsquo;ll
help ye if I can. (<i>Potius quam pereas.</i>) (<i>He goes out.</i>)</p>





<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE V</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Sore hearing, does he say? My hand&rsquo;s wet.
But it&rsquo;s victory. Shall it be go? or stay? (I should
show them all I can, or they may pry closer than
they ought.) Shall I have it out and be done with it?
To see Mary at once (to carry bastion after bastion
at the charge)&mdash;there were the true safety after all!
Hurry&mdash;hurry&rsquo;s the road to silence now. Let them
once get tattling in their parlours, and it&rsquo;s death to me.
For I&rsquo;m in a cruel corner now. I&rsquo;m down, and I shall
get my kicking soon and soon enough. I began it in
the lust of life, in a hey-day of mystery and adventure.
I felt it great to be a bolder, craftier rogue than the
drowsy citizen that called himself my fellow-man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>43</span>
(It was meat and drink to know him in the hollow
of my hand, hoarding that I and mine might squander,
pinching that we might wax fat.) It was in the
laughter of my heart that I tip-toed into his greasy
privacy. I forced the strong-box at his ear while he
sprawled beside his wife. He was my butt, my ape,
my jumping-jack. And now ... O fool, fool!
(Duped by such knaves as are a shame to knavery,
crime&rsquo;s rabble, hell&rsquo;s tatterdemalions!) Shorn to the
quick! Rooked to my vitals! And I must thieve
for my daily bread like any crawling blackguard in
the gutter. And my sister ... my kind, innocent
sister! She will come smiling to me with her poor
little love-story, and I must break her heart. Broken
hearts, broken lives!... I should have died
before.</p>

<h4>SCENE VI</h4>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Brodie, Mary</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary</span> (<i>tapping without</i>). Can I come in, Will?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> O yes, come in, come in! (<i><span class="sc">Mary</span> enters.</i>) I
wanted to be quiet, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter, I see. You
women are all the same.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> O no, Will, they&rsquo;re not all so happy, and they&rsquo;re
not all Brodies. But I&rsquo;ll be a woman in one thing. For
I&rsquo;ve come to claim your promise, dear; and I&rsquo;m going
to be petted and comforted and made much of, although
I don&rsquo;t need it, and.... Why, Will, what&rsquo;s
wrong with you? You look ... I don&rsquo;t know
what you look like.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> O nothing! A splitting head and an aching
heart. Well! you&rsquo;ve come to speak to me. Speak
up. What is it? Come, girl! What is it? Can&rsquo;t
you speak?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Why, Will, what is the matter?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>44</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I thought you had come to tell me something.
Here I am. For God&rsquo;s sake out with it, and don&rsquo;t
stand beating about the bush.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> O be kind, be kind to me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Kind? I am kind. I&rsquo;m only ill and worried,
can&rsquo;t you see? Whimpering? I knew it! Sit down,
you goose! Where do you women get your tears?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Why are you so cross with me? O, Will, you
have forgot your sister! Remember, dear, that I
have nobody but you. It&rsquo;s your own fault, Will, if
you&rsquo;ve taught me to come to you for kindness, for
I always found it. And I mean you shall be kind to
me again. I know you will, for this is my great need,
and the day I&rsquo;ve missed my mother sorest. Just a
nice look, dear, and a soft tone in your voice, to give
me courage, for I can tell you nothing till I know
that you&rsquo;re my own brother once again.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> If you&rsquo;d take a hint, you&rsquo;d put it off until to-morrow.
But I suppose you won&rsquo;t. On, then, I&rsquo;m
listening. I&rsquo;m listening!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Mr. Leslie has asked me to be his wife.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> He has, has he?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> And I have consented.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> And...?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> You can say that to me? And that is all you
have to say?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> O no, not all.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Speak out, sir. I am not afraid.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I suppose you want my consent?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Can you ask?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I didn&rsquo;t know. You seem to have got on pretty
well without it so far.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> O shame on you! shame on you!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Perhaps you may be able to do without it
altogether. I hope so. For you&rsquo;ll never have it....
Mary! ... I hate to see you look like that. If
I could say anything else, believe me, I would say it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>45</span>
But I have said all; every word is spoken; there&rsquo;s
the end.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> It shall not be the end. You owe me explanation;
and I&rsquo;ll have it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Isn&rsquo;t my &ldquo;No&rdquo; enough, Mary?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> It might be enough for me; but it is not, and it
cannot be, enough for him. He has asked me to be his
wife; he tells me his happiness is in my hands&mdash;poor
hands, but they shall not fail him, if my poor heart
should break! If he has chosen and set his hopes
upon me, of all women in the world, I shall find courage
somewhere to be worthy of the choice. And I dare
you to leave this room until you tell me all your
thoughts&mdash;until you prove that this is good and
right.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Good and right? They are strange words,
Mary. I mind the time when it was good and right
to be your father&rsquo;s daughter and your brother&rsquo;s sister....
Now!...</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Have I changed? Not even in thought. My
father, Walter says, shall live and die with us. He
shall only have gained another son. And you&mdash;you
know what he thinks of you; you know what I would
do for you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Give him up.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> I have told you: not without a reason.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> You must.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> I will not.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> What if I told you that you could only compass
your happiness and his at the price of my ruin?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Your ruin?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Even so.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Ruin!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> It has an ugly sound, has it not?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> O Willie, what have you done? What have you
done? What have you done?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I cannot tell you, Mary. But you may trust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>46</span>
me. You must give up this Leslie ... and at
once. It is to save me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> I would die for you, dear; you know that. But
I cannot be false to him. Even for you, I cannot be
false to him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> We shall see. Let me take you to your room.
Come. And, remember, it is for your brother&rsquo;s sake.
It is to save me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> I am a true Brodie. Give me time, and you shall
not find me wanting. But it is all so sudden ...
so strange and dreadful! You will give me time,
will you not? I am only a woman, and.... O
my poor Walter! It will break his heart! It will
break his heart! (<i>A knock.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> You hear!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Yes, yes. Forgive me. I am going. I will go.
It is to save you, is it not? To save you. Walter ...
Mr. Leslie ... O Deacon, Deacon, God
forgive you! (<i>She goes out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Amen. But will He?</p>




<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE VII</h4>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Brodie, Hunt</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt</span> (<i>hat in hand</i>). Mr. Deacon Brodie, I believe?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I am he, Mr&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Hunt, sir: an officer from Sir John Fielding of
Bow Street.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> There can be no better passport than the name.
In what can I serve you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> You&rsquo;ll excuse me, Mr. Deacon.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Your duty excuses you, Mr. Hunt.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Your obedient. The fact is, Mr. Deacon (we in
the office see a good deal of the lives of private parties;
and I needn&rsquo;t tell a gentleman of your experience it&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>47</span>
part of our duty to hold our tongues. Now), it comes
to our knowledge that you are a trifle jokieous. Of
course I know there ain&rsquo;t any harm in that. I&rsquo;ve
been young myself, Mr. Deacon, and speaking&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> O, but pardon me, Mr. Hunt, I am not going to
discuss my private character with you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> To be sure you ain&rsquo;t. (And do I blame you?
Not me.) But, speaking as one man of the world
to another, you naturally see a great deal of bad
company.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Not half so much as you do. But I see what
you&rsquo;re driving at; and if I can illuminate the course
of justice, you may command me. (<i>He sits, and
motions <span class="sc">Hunt</span> to do likewise.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> I was dead sure of it: and &rsquo;and upon &rsquo;art, Mr.
Deacon, I thank you. Now&mdash;(<i>consulting pocket-book</i>)&mdash;did
you ever meet a certain George Smith?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> The fellow they call Jingling Geordie? (<i><span class="sc">Hunt</span>
nods.</i>) Yes.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Bad character?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Let us say ... disreputable.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Any means of livelihood?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I really cannot pretend to guess. I have met
the creature at cock-fights (which, as you know, are
my weakness). Perhaps he bets.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> (Mr. Deacon, from what I know of the gentleman,
I should say that if he don&rsquo;t&mdash;if he ain&rsquo;t open to any
mortal thing&mdash;he ain&rsquo;t the man I mean.) He used
to be about with a man called Badger Moore.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> The boxer?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> That&rsquo;s him. Know anything of him?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Not much. I lost five pieces on him in a fight;
and I fear he sold his backers.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Speaking as one admirer of the noble art to another,
Mr. Deacon, the losers always do. I suppose the Badger
cock-fights like the rest of us?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I have met him in the pit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>48</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Well, it&rsquo;s a pretty sport. I&rsquo;m as partial to a
main as anybody.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> It&rsquo;s not an elegant taste, Mr. Hunt.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> It costs as much as though it was. And that
reminds me, speaking as one sportsman to another,
Mr. Deacon, I was sorry to hear that you&rsquo;ve been
dropping a hatful of money lately.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> You are very good.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Four hundred in three months, they tell me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Ah!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> So they say, sir.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> They have a perfect right to say so, Mr. Hunt.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> And you to do the other thing? Well, I&rsquo;m a good
hand at keeping close myself.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I am not consulting you, Mr. Hunt; &rsquo;tis you
who are consulting me. And if there is nothing else
(<i>rising</i>) in which I can pretend to serve you...?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt</span> (<i>rising</i>). That&rsquo;s about all, sir, unless you can
put me on to anything good in the way of heckle and
spur? I&rsquo;d try to look in.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> O come, Mr. Hunt, if you have nothing to do,
frankly and flatly I have. This is not the day for
such a conversation; and so good-bye to you. (<i>A
knocking, C.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Servant, Mr. Deacon. (<i><span class="sc">Smith</span> and <span class="sc">Moore</span>,
without waiting to be answered, open and enter, C. They
are well into the room before they observe <span class="sc">Hunt</span>.</i>) (Talk
of the devil, sir!)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> What brings you here? (<i><span class="sc">Smith</span> and <span class="sc">Moore</span>,
confounded by the officer&rsquo;s presence, slouch together
to right of door. <span class="sc">Hunt</span>, stopping as he goes out, contemplates
the pair, sarcastically. This is supported
by <span class="sc">Moore</span> with sullen bravado; by <span class="sc">Smith</span> with cringing
airiness.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt</span> (<i>digging <span class="sc">Smith</span> in the ribs</i>). Why, you are the
very parties I was looking for! (<i>He goes out, C.</i>)</p>





<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>49</span></p>

<h4>SCENE VIII</h4>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Brodie, Moore, Smith</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Wot was that cove here about?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>with folded arms, half-sitting on bench</i>). He
was here about you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith</span> (<i>still quite discountenanced</i>). About us? Scissors!
And what did you tell him?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>same attitude</i>). I spoke of you as I have found
you. (I told him you were a disreputable hound, and
that Moore had crossed a fight.) I told him you were
a drunken ass, and Moore an incompetent and dishonest
boxer.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Look here, Deacon! Wot&rsquo;s up? Wot I ses
is, if a cove&rsquo;s got any thundering grudge agin a cove,
why can&rsquo;t he spit it out, I ses.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Here are my answers. (<i>Producing purse and
dice.</i>) These are both too light. This purse is empty,
these dice are not loaded. Is it indiscretion to inquire
how you share? Equal with the Captain, I
presume?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> It&rsquo;s as easy as my eye, Deakin. Slink Ainslie
got letting the merry glass go round, and didn&rsquo;t know
the right bones from the wrong. That&rsquo;s <i>h</i>all.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> (What clumsy liars you are!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> In boyhood&rsquo;s hour, Deakin, he were called Old
Truthful. Little did he think&mdash;&mdash;)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> What is your errand?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Business.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> After the melancholy games of last night, Deakin,
which no one deplores so much as George Smith, we
thought we&rsquo;d trot round&mdash;didn&rsquo;t us, Hump?&mdash;and
see how you and your bankers was a-getting on.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Will you tell me your errand?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> You&rsquo;re dry, ain&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Am I?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>50</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> We ain&rsquo;t none of us got a stiver, that&rsquo;s wot&rsquo;s
the matter with us.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Is it?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Ay, strike me, it is! And wot we&rsquo;ve got to
do is to put up the Excise.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> It&rsquo;s the last plant in the shrubbery, Deakin, and
it&rsquo;s breaking George the gardener&rsquo;s heart, it is. We
really must!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Must we?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Must&rsquo;s the thundering word. I mean business,
I do.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> That&rsquo;s lucky. I don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> O, you don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I do not.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Then p&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;ll tell us wot you thundering
well do?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> What do I mean? I mean that you and that
merry-andrew shall walk out of this room and this
house. Do you suppose, you blockheads, that I am
blind? I&rsquo;m the Deacon, am I not? I&rsquo;ve been your
king and your commander. I&rsquo;ve led you and fed you
and thought for you with this head. And you think
to steal a march upon a man like me? I see you
through and through (I know you like the clock); I
read your thoughts like print. Brodie, you thought,
has money, and won&rsquo;t do the job. Therefore, you
thought, we must rook him to the heart. And therefore,
you put up your idiot cockney. And now you
come round, and dictate, and think sure of your
Excise? Sure? Are you sure I&rsquo;ll let you pack with
a whole skin? By my soul, but I&rsquo;ve a mind to pistol
you like dogs. Out of this! Out, I say, and soil my
home no more.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore</span> (<i>sitting</i>). Now look &rsquo;ere. Mr. bloody Deacon Brodie,
you see this &rsquo;ere chair of yours, don&rsquo;t you? Wot I
ses to you is, Here I am, I ses, and here I mean to stick.
That&rsquo;s my motto. Who the devil are you to do the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>51</span>
high and mighty? You make all you can out of us,
don&rsquo;t you? and when one of your plants goes cross,
you order us out of the ken? Muck! That&rsquo;s wot
I think of you. Muck! Don&rsquo;t you get coming the
nob over me, Mr. Deacon Brodie, or I&rsquo;ll smash you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> You will?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Ay will I. If I thundering well swing for it.
And as for clearing out? Muck! Here I am, and
here I stick. Clear out? You try it on. I&rsquo;m a
man, I am.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> This is plain speaking.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Plain? Wot about your father as can&rsquo;t walk?
Wot about your fine-madam sister? Wot about the
stone-jug, and the dock, and the rope in the open
street? Is that plain? If it ain&rsquo;t, you let me know,
and I&rsquo;ll spit it out so as it&rsquo;ll raise the roof of this &rsquo;ere
ken. Plain! I&rsquo;m that cove&rsquo;s master, and I&rsquo;ll make
it plain enough for him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> What do you want of me?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Wot do I want of you? Now you speak sense.
Leslie&rsquo;s is wot I want of you. The Excise is wot I
want of you. Leslie&rsquo;s to-night and the Excise to-morrow.
That&rsquo;s wot I want of you, and wot I thundering
well mean to get.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Damn you!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Amen. But you&rsquo;ve got your orders.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>with pistol</i>). Orders? hey? orders?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith</span> (<i>between them</i>). Deacon, Deacon!&mdash;Badger, are
you mad?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Muck! That&rsquo;s my motto. Wot I ses is, Has he
got his orders or has he not? That&rsquo;s wot&rsquo;s the matter
with him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Deacon, half a tick. Humphrey, I&rsquo;m only a
light weight, and you fight at twelve stone ten, but
I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;m going to stand still and see you
hitting a pal when he&rsquo;s down.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Muck! That&rsquo;s wot I think of you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>52</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> He&rsquo;s a cut above us, ain&rsquo;t he? He never sold
his backers, did he? We couldn&rsquo;t have done without
him, could we? You dry up about his old man,
and his sister; and don&rsquo;t go on hitting a pal when
he&rsquo;s knocked out of time and cannot hit back, for,
damme, I will not stand it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Amen to you. But I&rsquo;m cock of this here thundering
walk, and that cove&rsquo;s got his orders.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>putting pistol on bench</i>). I give in. I will do
your work for you once more. Leslie&rsquo;s to-night and
the Excise to-morrow. If that is enough, if you
have no more ... orders, you may count it as
done.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Fen larks. No rotten shirking, mind.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I have passed you my word. And now you
have said what you came to say, you must go. I
have business here; but two hours hence I am at
your ... orders. Where shall I await you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> What about that woman&rsquo;s place of yours?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Your will is my law.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> That&rsquo;s good enough. Now, Dook.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Bye-bye, my William. Don&rsquo;t forget.</p>





<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE IX</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Trust me. No man forgets his vice, you dogs,
or forgives it either. It must be done: Leslie&rsquo;s to-night
and the Excise to-morrow. It shall be done.
This settles it. They used to fetch and carry for
me, and now ... I&rsquo;ve licked their boots, have I?
I&rsquo;m their man, their tool, their chattel. It&rsquo;s the
bottom rung of the ladder of shame. I sound with
my foot, and there&rsquo;s nothing underneath but the
black emptiness of damnation. Ah, Deacon, Deacon,
and so this is where you&rsquo;ve been travelling all these
years; and it&rsquo;s for this that you learned French! The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>53</span>
gallows ... God help me, it begins to dog me
like my shadow. <i>There&rsquo;s</i> a step to take! And
the jerk upon your spine! How&rsquo;s a man to die with
a night-cap on? I&rsquo;ve done with this. Over
yonder, across the great ocean, is a new land, with
new characters, and perhaps new lives. The sun
shines, and the bells ring, and it&rsquo;s a place where
men live gladly; and the Deacon himself can walk
without terror, and begin again like a new-born child.
It must be good to see day again and not to fear;
it must be good to be one&rsquo;s self with all men. Happy
like a child, wise like a man, free like God&rsquo;s angels
... should I work these hands off and eat crusts,
there were a life to make me young and good again.
And it&rsquo;s only over the sea! O man, you have been
blind, and now your eyes are opened. It was half
a life&rsquo;s nightmare, and now you are awake. Up,
Deacon, up, it&rsquo;s hope that&rsquo;s at the window! Mary!
Mary! Mary!</p>




<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE X</h4>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Brodie, Mary, Old Brodie</span></p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Brodie</span> has fallen into a chair, with his face upon the table.
Enter <span class="sc">Mary</span>, by the side door, pushing her father&rsquo;s chair.
She is supposed to have advanced far enough for stage
purposes before <span class="sc">Brodie</span> is aware of her. He starts up
and runs to her.</i></p>
<div style="padding-top: 0.5em; ">&nbsp;</div>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Look up, my lass, look up, and be a woman!
I.... O, kiss me, Mary! give me a kiss for my
good news.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Good news, Will? Is it changed?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Changed? Why, the world&rsquo;s a different colour!
It was night, and now it&rsquo;s broad day, and I trust
myself again. You must wait, dear, wait, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>54</span>
must work and work; and before the week is out,
as sure as God sees me, I&rsquo;ll have made you happy.
O you may think me broken, hounds, but the Deacon&rsquo;s
not the man to be run down; trust him, he shall turn
a corner yet, and leave you snarling! And you, Poll,
you. I&rsquo;ve done nothing for you yet; but, please God,
I&rsquo;ll make your life a life of gold; and wherever I am,
I&rsquo;ll have a part in your happiness, and you&rsquo;ll know it,
by heaven! and bless me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> O Willie, look at him; I think he hears you, and
is trying to be glad with us.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Old Brodie.</span> My son&mdash;Deacon&mdash;better man than I was.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> O, for God&rsquo;s sake, hear him!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> He is quite happy, Will, and so am I ... so
am I.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Hear me, Mary. This is a big moment in
our two lives. I swear to you by the father here
between us that it shall not be fault of mine if this
thing fails; if this ship founders you have set your
hopes in. I swear it by our father; I swear it by
God&rsquo;s judgments.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> I want no oaths, Will.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> No, but I do. And prayers, Mary, prayers.
Pray night and day upon your knees. I must move
mountains.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Old Brodie.</span> A wise son maketh&mdash;maketh&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> A glad father? And does your son, the Deacon,
make you glad? O heaven of heavens, if I were a
good man!</p>

<p><i>They loiter in L., and stand looking about as for somebody

<div style="padding-top: 0.5em; ">&nbsp;</div>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Wot did I tell you? Is he &rsquo;ere or ain&rsquo;t he?
Now then. Slink by name and Slink by nature,
that&rsquo;s wot&rsquo;s the matter with him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> He&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; be lang; he&rsquo;s regular enough, if that
was a&rsquo;.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> I&rsquo;d regular him; I&rsquo;d break his back.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Badger, you brute, you hang on to the lessons
of your dancing-master. None but the genteel deserves
the fair; does they, Duchess?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> O rot! Did I insult the blowen? Wot&rsquo;s the
matter with me is Slink Ainslie.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> All right, old Crossed-in-love. Give him forty
winks, and he&rsquo;ll turn up as fresh as clean sawdust
and as respectable as a new Bible.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> That&rsquo;s right enough; but I ain&rsquo;t a-going to
stand here all day for him. I&rsquo;m for a drop of something
short, I am. You tell him I showed you that

<h4>SCENE II</h4>

<p class="ct"><i><span class="sc">Smith</span> and <span class="sc">Jean</span>, to whom <span class="sc">Hunt</span> and afterwards
<span class="sc">Moore</span></i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith</span> (<i>critically</i>). No, Duchess, he has not good manners.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> Ay, he&rsquo;s an impident man.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> So he is, Jean; and for the matter of that he
ain&rsquo;t the only one.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> Geordie, I want nae mair o&rsquo; your nonsense, mind.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> There&rsquo;s our old particular the Deacon, now.
Why is he ashamed of a lovely woman? That&rsquo;s not
my idea of the Young Chevalier, Jean. If I had
luck, we should be married, and retired to our estates
in the country, shouldn&rsquo;t us? and go to church and
be happy, like the nobility and gentry.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> Geordie Smith, div ye mean ye&rsquo;d mairry me?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Mean it? What else has ever been the &rsquo;umble
petition of your honest but well-meaning friend, Roman,
and fellow-countryman? I know the Deacon&rsquo;s your
man, and I know he&rsquo;s a cut above G. S.; but he won&rsquo;t
last, Jean, and I shall.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> Ay, I&rsquo;m muckle ta&rsquo;en up wi&rsquo; him; wha could
help it?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Well, and my sort don&rsquo;t grow on apple-trees,
either.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> Ye&rsquo;re a fine, cracky, neebourly body, Geordie, if
ye wad just let me be.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> I know I ain&rsquo;t a Scotsman born.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> I dinna think sae muckle the waur o&rsquo; ye even for
that; if ye would just let me be.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt</span> (<i>entering behind, aside</i>). (Are they thick? Anyhow,
it&rsquo;s a second chance.)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> But he won&rsquo;t last, Jean; and when he leaves
you, you come to me. Is that your taste in pastry?
That&rsquo;s the kind of <i>h</i>article that I present!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>57</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt</span> (<i>surprising them as in Tableau I</i>). Why, you&rsquo;re
the very parties I was looking for!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> Mercy me!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Damn it, Jerry, this is unkind.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> (Now this is what I call a picter of good fortune.)
Ain&rsquo;t it strange I should have dropped across you comfortable
and promiscuous like this?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean</span> (<i>stolidly</i>). I hope ye&rsquo;re middling weel, Mr. Hunt?
(<i>Going.</i>) Mr. Smith!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Mrs. Watt, ma&rsquo;am! (<i>Going.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Hold hard, George. Speaking as one lady&rsquo;s man
to another, turn about&rsquo;s fair play. You&rsquo;ve had your
confab, and now I&rsquo;m going to have mine. (Not
that I&rsquo;ve done with you; you stand by and wait.)
Ladies first, George, ladies first; that&rsquo;s the size of
it. (<i>To <span class="sc">Jean</span>, aside.</i>) Now, Mrs. Watt, I take it
you ain&rsquo;t a natural fool?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> And thank ye kindly, Mr. Hunt.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith</span> (<i>interfering</i>). Jean...!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt</span> (<i>keeping him off</i>). Half a tick, George. (<i>To
<span class="sc">Jean</span>.</i>) Mrs. Watt, I&rsquo;ve a warrant in my pocket.
One, two, three: will you peach?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> Whatten kind of a word&rsquo;ll that be?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Mum it is, Jean!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> <i>When</i> you&rsquo;ve done dancing, George! (<i>To <span class="sc">Jean</span>.</i>)
It ain&rsquo;t a pretty expression, my dear, I own it. &ldquo;Will
you blow the gaff?&rdquo; is perhaps more tenderer.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> I think ye&rsquo;ve a real strange way o&rsquo; expressin&rsquo;
yoursel&rsquo;.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt</span> (<i>to <span class="sc">Jean</span></i>). I can&rsquo;t waste time on you, my girl.
It&rsquo;s now or never. Will you turn King&rsquo;s evidence?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> I think ye&rsquo;ll have made a mistake, like.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Well, I&rsquo;m...! (<i>Separating them.</i>) (No, not
yet; don&rsquo;t push me.) George&rsquo;s turn now. (<i>To
<span class="sc">George</span>.</i>) George, I&rsquo;ve a warrant in my pocket.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> As per usual, Jerry?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Now I want King&rsquo;s evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>58</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Ah! so you came a cropper with <i>her</i>, Jerry.
Pride had a fall.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> A free pardon and fifty shiners down.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> A free pardon, Jerry?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Don&rsquo;t I tell you so?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> And fifty down? fifty?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> On the nail.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> So you came a cropper with her, and then you
tried it on with me?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> I suppose you mean you&rsquo;re a born idiot?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> What I mean is, Jerry, that you&rsquo;ve broke my
heart. I used to look up to you like a party might
to Julius Cæsar. One more of boyhood&rsquo;s dreams
gone pop! (<i>Enter <span class="sc">Moore</span>, L.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt</span> (<i>to both</i>). Come, then, I&rsquo;ll take the pair, and be
damned to you. Free pardon to both, fifty down and
the Deacon out of the way. I don&rsquo;t care for you
commoners, it&rsquo;s the Deacon I want.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean</span> (<i>looking off stolidly</i>). I think the kirks are scalin&rsquo;.
There seems to be mair people in the streets.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> O, that&rsquo;s the way, is it? Do you know that I
can hang you, my woman, and your fancy man as well?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> I daur say ye would like fine to, Mr. Hunt; and
here&rsquo;s my service to you. (<i>Going.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> George, don&rsquo;t you be a tomfool, anyway. Think
of the blowen here, and have brains for two.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith</span> (<i>going</i>). Ah, Jerry, if you knew anything, how
different you would talk! (<i>They go off together, R.</i>)</p>




<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE III</h4>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Hunt, Moore</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Half a tick, Badger. You&rsquo;re a man of parts, you
are; you&rsquo;re solid, you&rsquo;re a true-born Englishman;
you ain&rsquo;t a Jerry-go-Nimble like him. Do you know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>59</span>
what your pal the Deacon&rsquo;s worth to you? Fifty
golden Georges and a free pardon. No questions
asked and no receipts demanded. What do you say?
Is it a deal?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore</span> (<i>as to himself</i>). Muck! (<i>He goes out, R.</i>)</p>




<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE IV</h4>

<p class="ct"><i><span class="sc">Hunt</span>, to whom <span class="sc">Ainslie</span></i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt</span> (<i>looking after them ruefully</i>). And these were the
very parties I was looking for! (Ah, Jerry, Jerry,
if they knew this at the office!) Well, the market
price of that &rsquo;ere two hundred is a trifle on the decline
and fall. (<i>Looking L.</i>) Hullo! (<i>Slapping his thigh.</i>)
Send me victorious! It&rsquo;s King&rsquo;s evidence on two legs.
(<i>Advancing with great cordiality to meet <span class="sc">Ainslie</span>, who
enters L.</i>) And so your name&rsquo;s Andrew Ainslie, is
it? As I was saying, you&rsquo;re the very party I was
looking for. Ain&rsquo;t it strange, now, that I should have
dropped across you comfortable and promiscuous like
this?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie.</span> I dinna ken wha ye are, and I&rsquo;m ill for my
bed.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Let your bed wait, Andrew. I want a little
chat with you; just a quiet little sociable wheeze.
Just about our friends, you know. About Badger
Moore, and George the Dook, and Jemmy Rivers,
and Deacon Brodie, Andrew. Particularly Deacon
Brodie.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie.</span> They&rsquo;re nae frien&rsquo;s o&rsquo; mine, mister. I ken
naething an&rsquo; naebody. An&rsquo; noo I&rsquo;ll get to my bed,
wulln&rsquo;t I?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> We&rsquo;re going to have our little talk out first. After
that perhaps I&rsquo;ll let you go, and perhaps I won&rsquo;t. It
all depends on how we get along together. Now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>60</span>
in a general way, Andrew, and speaking of a man as
you find him, I&rsquo;m all for peace and quietness myself.
That&rsquo;s my usual game, Andrew, but when I
do make a dust I&rsquo;m considered by my friends to be
rather a good hand at it. So don&rsquo;t you tread upon
the worm.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie.</span> But I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> You leave that to me, Andrew. You shall do
your pitch presently. I&rsquo;m first on the ground, and
I lead off. With a question, Andrew. Did you ever
hear in your life of such a natural curiosity as a Bow
Street Runner?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie.</span> Aiblins ay an&rsquo; aiblins no.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> &ldquo;Aiblins ay an&rsquo; aiblins no.&rdquo; Very good indeed,
Andrew. Now, I&rsquo;ll ask you another: Did you ever
see a Bow Street Runner, Andrew? With the naked
eye, so to speak?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie.</span> What&rsquo;s your wull?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Artful bird! Now since we&rsquo;re getting on so cosy
and so free, I&rsquo;ll ask you another, Andrew: Should
you like to see a Bow Street Runner? (<i>Producing
staff.</i>) &rsquo;Cos, if so, you&rsquo;ve only got to cast your eyes
on me. Do you queer the red weskit, Andrew?
Pretty colour, ain&rsquo;t it? So nice and warm for the
winter too. (<i><span class="sc">Ainslie</span> dives, <span class="sc">Hunt</span> collars him.</i>) No,
you don&rsquo;t. Not this time. Run away like that before
we&rsquo;ve finished our little conversation? You&rsquo;re a
nice young man, you are. Suppose we introduce our
wrists into these here darbies? Now we shall get
along cosier and freer than ever. Want to lie down,
do you? All right! anything to oblige.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie</span> (<i>grovelling</i>). It wasna me, it wasna me. It&rsquo;s
bad companions; I&rsquo;ve been lost wi&rsquo; bad companions
an&rsquo; the drink. An&rsquo; O mister, ye&rsquo;ll be a kind gentleman
to a puir lad, and me sae weak, and fair rotten
wi&rsquo; the drink an&rsquo; that. Ye&rsquo;ve a bonnie kind heart,
my dear, dear gentleman; ye wadna hang sitchan a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>61</span>
thing as me. I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; fit to hang. They ca&rsquo; me the
Cannleworm! An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll dae somethin&rsquo; for ye, wulln&rsquo;t
I? An&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ll can hang the ithers?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> I thought I hadn&rsquo;t mistook my man. Now you
look here, Andrew Ainslie, you&rsquo;re a bad lot. I&rsquo;ve
evidence to hang you fifty times over. But the Deacon
is my mark. Will you peach, or won&rsquo;t you? You
blow the gaff, and I&rsquo;ll pull you through. You don&rsquo;t,
and I&rsquo;ll scrag you as sure as my name&rsquo;s Jerry Hunt.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie.</span> I&rsquo;ll dae onything. It&rsquo;s the hanging fleys me.
I&rsquo;ll dae onything, onything no&rsquo; to hang.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Don&rsquo;t lie crawling there, but get up and answer
me like a man. Ain&rsquo;t this Deacon Brodie the fine
workman that&rsquo;s been doing all these tip-topping
burglaries?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie.</span> It&rsquo;s him, mister; it&rsquo;s him. That&rsquo;s the man.
Ye&rsquo;re in the very bit. Deacon Brodie. I&rsquo;ll can tak&rsquo;
ye to his very door.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> How do you know?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie.</span> I gi&rsquo;ed him a han&rsquo; wi&rsquo; them a&rsquo;. It was him
an&rsquo; Badger Moore and Geordie Smith; an&rsquo; they
gart me gang wi&rsquo; them whether or no: I&rsquo;m that weak,
and whiles I&rsquo;m donner&rsquo;d wi&rsquo; the drink. But I ken a&rsquo;
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell a&rsquo;. And O kind gentleman, you&rsquo;ll speak to
their lordships for me, and I&rsquo;ll no be hangit ...
I&rsquo;ll no be hangit, wull I?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> But you shared, didn&rsquo;t you? I wonder what
share they thought you worth. How much did you get
for last night&rsquo;s performance down at Mother Clarke&rsquo;s?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie.</span> Just five pund, mister. Five pund. As sure&rsquo;s
deith it wadna be a penny mair. No&rsquo; but I askit
mair: I did that; I&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; deny it, mister. But
Badger kickit me, an&rsquo; Geordie, he said a bad sweir,
an&rsquo; made he&rsquo;d cut the liver out o&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; catch fish
wi&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s been that way frae the first: an aith an&rsquo; a
bawbee was aye guid eneuch for puir Andra.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> Well, and why did they do it? I saw Jemmy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>62</span>
dance a hornpipe on the table, and booze the company
all round, when the Deacon was gone. What
made you cross the fight, and play booty with your
own man?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie.</span> Just to make him rob the Excise, mister. They&rsquo;re
wicked, wicked men.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> And is he right for it?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie.</span> Ay is he.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> By Jingo! When&rsquo;s it for?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie.</span> Dear, kind gentleman, I dinna rightly ken:
the Deacon&rsquo;s that sair angered wi&rsquo; me. I&rsquo;m to get
my orders frae Geordie the nicht.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> O, you&rsquo;re to get your orders from Geordie, are you?
Now look here, Ainslie. You know me. I&rsquo;m Hunt the
Runner: I put Jemmy Rivers in the jug this morning;
I&rsquo;ve got you this evening. I mean to wind up with the
Deacon. You understand? All right. Then just
you listen. I&rsquo;m going to take these here bracelets off,
and send you home to that celebrated bed of yours.
Only, as soon as you&rsquo;ve seen the Dook you come straight
round to me at Mr. Procurator-Fiscal&rsquo;s, and let me
know the Dook&rsquo;s views. One word, mind, and ...
cl&rsquo;k! It&rsquo;s a bargain?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie.</span>. Never you fear that. I&rsquo;ll tak&rsquo; my bannet an&rsquo;
come straucht to ye. Eh God, I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s nae mair
nor that to start wi&rsquo;. An&rsquo; may the Lord bless ye,
dear, kind gentleman, for your kindness! May the
Lord bless ye!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt.</span> You pad the hoof.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie</span> (<i>going out</i>). An&rsquo; so I wull, wulln&rsquo;t I not? An&rsquo;
bless, bless ye while there&rsquo;s breath in my body, wulln&rsquo;t
I not?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hunt</span> (<i>solus</i>). You&rsquo;re a nice young man, Andrew Ainslie.
Jemmy Rivers and the Deacon in two days! By
Jingo! (<i>He dances an instant gravely, whistling to
himself.</i>) Jerry, that &rsquo;ere little two hundred of ours
is as safe as the bank.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Weel, weel, weel, weel, nae doubt.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Mr. Lawson, I am perfectly satisfied with Brodie&rsquo;s
word; I will wait gladly.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> I have nothing to say against that.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>behind <span class="sc">Lawson</span></i>). Nor for it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> For it? for it, William? Ye&rsquo;re perfectly
richt there. (<i>To <span class="sc">Leslie</span>.</i>) Just you do what William
tells you; ye canna do better than that.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Dear uncle, I see you are vexed; but Will and
I are perfectly agreed on the best course. Walter
and I are young. O, we can wait; we can trust
each other.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>from behind</i>). Leslie, do you think it safe to
keep this strong-box in your room?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> It does not trouble me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I would not. &rsquo;Tis close to the window.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> It&rsquo;s on the right side of it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I give you my advice: I would not.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> He may be right there too, Mr. Leslie.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I give him fair warning: it&rsquo;s not safe.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> I have a different treasure to concern myself
about; if all goes right with that I shall be well contented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>64</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Walter!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Ay, bairns, ye speak for your age.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Surely, sir, for every age: the ties of blood, of
love, of friendship, these are life&rsquo;s essence.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> And for no one is it truer than my uncle. If he
live to be a thousand, he will still be young in heart,
full of love, full of trust.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Ah, lassie, it&rsquo;s a wicked world.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Yes, you are out of sorts to-day; we know that.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Admitted that you know more of life, sir; admitted
(if you please) that the world is wicked; yet
you do not lose trust in those you love.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Weel ... ye get gliffs, ye ken.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> I suppose so. We can all be shaken for a time;
but not, I think, in our friends. We are not deceived
in them; in the few that we admit into our hearts.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Never in these.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> We know these (<i>to <span class="sc">Brodie</span></i>), and we think the
world of them.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>at back</i>). We are more acquainted with each
other&rsquo;s tailors, believe me. You, Leslie, are a very
pleasant creature. My uncle Lawson is the Procurator-Fiscal.
I&mdash;what am I? I am the Deacon of the
Wrights; my ruffles are generally clean; and you
think the world of me. Bravo!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Ay, and I think the world of you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>at back, pointing to <span class="sc">Lawson</span></i>). Ask him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Hoot-toot. A wheen nonsense: an honest

thief, and neither mair nor less. Mary, my lamb,

<h4>SCENE II</h4>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Leslie, Lawson</span> (<i>wrapping up</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie</span>. I wonder what ails Brodie?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> How should I ken? What should I ken that
ails him?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> He seemed angry even with you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson</span> (<i>impatient</i>). Hoot awa&rsquo;!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Of course, I know. But you see, on the very
day when our engagement is announced, even the
best of men may be susceptible. You yourself seem
not quite pleased.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson</span> (<i>with great irritation</i>). I&rsquo;m perfectly pleased.
I&rsquo;m perfectly delighted. If I werena an auld man,
I&rsquo;d be just beside mysel&rsquo; wi&rsquo; happiness.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Well, I only fancied ...</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Ye had nae possible excuse to fancy. Fancy?
Perfect trash and nonsense. Look at yersel&rsquo;. Ye
look like a ghaist, ye&rsquo;re white-like, ye&rsquo;re black aboot
the een; and do you find me deavin&rsquo; ye wi&rsquo; fancies?
Or William Brodie either? I&rsquo;ll say that for him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> &rsquo;Tis not sorrow that alters my complexion; I&rsquo;ve
something else on hand. Come, I&rsquo;ll tell you, under
seal. I&rsquo;ve not been in bed till daylight for a week.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Weel, there&rsquo;s nae sense in the like o&rsquo; that.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Gad, but there is, though. Why, Procurator,
this is town&rsquo;s business; this is a municipal affair;
I&rsquo;m a public character. Why? Ah, here&rsquo;s a nut for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>66</span>
the Crown Prosecutor! I&rsquo;m a bit of a party to a robbery.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Guid guide us, man, what d&rsquo;ye mean?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> You shall hear. A week ago to-night I was
passing through this very room without a candle on my
way to bed, when ... what should I see but a
masked man fumbling at that window! How he did the
Lord knows. I suspect, Procurator, it was not the
first he&rsquo;d tried ... for he opened it as handily
as his own front door.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Preserve me! Another of thae robberies!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> That&rsquo;s it. And, of course, I tried to seize him.
But the rascal was too quick. He was down and away
in an instant. You never saw a thing so daring and
adroit.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Is that a&rsquo;? Ye&rsquo;re a bauld lad, I&rsquo;ll say that for
ye. I&rsquo;m glad it wasna waur.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Yes, that&rsquo;s all plain sailing. But here&rsquo;s the hitch.
Why didn&rsquo;t I tell the Procurator-Fiscal? You never
thought of that.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> No, man. Why?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Aha! There&rsquo;s the riddle. Will you guess?
No?... I thought I knew the man.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> What d&rsquo;ye say?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> I thought I knew him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Wha was&rsquo;t?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Ah, there you go beyond me. That I cannot tell.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> As God sees ye, laddie, are ye speaking truth?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Well ... of course!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> The haill truth?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> All of it. Why not?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Man, I&rsquo;d a kind o&rsquo; gliff.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Why, what were you afraid of? Had you a
suspicion?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Me? Me a suspicion? Ye&rsquo;re daft, sir; and
me the Crown offeecial!... Eh, man, I&rsquo;m a&rsquo;
shakin&rsquo; ... And sae ye thocht ye kennt him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>67</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> I did that. And what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ve sat every
night in case of his return. I promise you, Procurator,
he shall not slip me twice. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m
worried and put out. You understand how such a
fancy will upset a man. I&rsquo;m uneasy with my friends
and on bad terms with my own conscience. I keep
watching, spying, comparing, putting two and two
together, and hunting for resemblances until my head
goes round. It&rsquo;s like a puzzle in a dream. Only
yesterday I thought I had him. And who d&rsquo;you think
it was?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Wha? Wha was&rsquo;t? Speak, Mr. Leslie, speak.
I&rsquo;m an auld man: dinna forget that.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> I name no names. It would be unjust to him;
and, upon my word, it was so silly it would be unfair
to me. However, here I sit, night after night. I
mean him to come back; come back he shall; and I&rsquo;ll
tell you who he was next morning.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Let sleeping dogs lie, Mr. Leslie; ye dinna
ken what ye micht see. And then, leave him alane,
he&rsquo;ll come nae mair. And sitting up a&rsquo; nicht ...
it&rsquo;s a <i>factum imprestabile</i>, as we say: a thing impossible
to man. Gang ye to your bed, like a guid laddie,
and sleep lang and soundly, and bonnie, bonnie dreams
to ye! (<i>Without.</i>) Let sleeping dogs lie, and gang ye
to your bed.</p>





<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE III</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie</span> (<i>calling</i>). In good time, never fear! (<i>He carefully
bolts and chains the door.</i>) The old gentleman
seems upset. What for, I wonder? Has he had a
masked visitor? Why not? It&rsquo;s the fashion. Out
with the lights. (<i>Blows out the candles. The stage
is only lighted by the moon through the window.</i>) He is
sure to come one night or other. He must come.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>68</span>
Right or wrong, I feel it in the air. Man, but I know
you, I know you somewhere. That trick of the shoulders,
the hang of the clothes&mdash;whose are they? Where
have I seen them? And then, that single look of the
eye, that one glance about the room as the window
opened ... it is almost friendly; I have caught
it over the glass&rsquo;s rim! If it should be ... his?
No, his it is not.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Watchman</span> (<i>without</i>). Past ten o&rsquo;clock, and a fine moonlight
night.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Another</span> (<i>further away</i>). Past ten o&rsquo;clock, and all&rsquo;s
well.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Past ten? Ah, there&rsquo;s a long night before you
and me, watchmen. Heavens, what a trade! But
it will be something to laugh over with Mary and
... with him! Damn it, the delusion is too strong
for me. It&rsquo;s a thing to be ashamed of. &ldquo;We Brodies&rdquo;:
how she says it! &ldquo;We Brodies and our Deacon&rdquo;:
what a pride she takes in it, and how good it sounds to
me! &ldquo;Deacon of his craft, sir, Deacon of the ...&rdquo;
(<i><span class="sc">Brodie</span>, masked, appears without at the window, which
he proceeds to force.</i>) Ha! I knew he&rsquo;d come. I was
sure of it. (<i>He crouches near and nearer to the window,
keeping in the shade.</i>) And I know you too. I swear
I know you.</p>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Brodie, Leslie</span></p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Brodie</span> enters by the window with assurance and ease,

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>in the moonlight</i>). Brodie.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> You ... you, Brodie, you!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Brodie, sir, Brodie, as you see.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> What does it mean? What does it mean? My
God! Were you here before? Is this the second
time? Are you a thief, man? are you a thief?
Speak, speak, or I&rsquo;ll kill you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I am a thief.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> And my friend, my own friend, and ...
Mary, Mary!... Deacon, Deacon, for God&rsquo;s sake,
no!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> A thief&rsquo;s sister! Why are you here? why are
you here? Tell me! Why do you not speak? Man,
I know you of old. Are you Brodie, and have nothing
to say?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> To say? Not much&mdash;God help me!&mdash;and commonplace,
commonplace like sin. I was honest once;
I made a false step; I couldn&rsquo;t retrace it; and ...
that is all.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> You have forgot the bad companions!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I did forget them. They were there.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Commonplace! Commonplace! Do you speak
to me, do you reason with me, do you make excuses?
You&mdash;a man found out, shamed, a liar, a thief&mdash;a man
that&rsquo;s killed me, killed this heart in my body; and
you speak! What am I to do? I hold your life in my
hand; have you thought of that? What am I to do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>70</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I have told you so much. You may as well

know all. That good man knows it already. Have
you issued a warrant for me ... yet?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> No, no, man: not another word.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>pointing to the window</i>). That is my work. I

<p><span class="sc">Lawson</span> (<i>breaking down</i>). Your father&rsquo;s son!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie</span> (<i>to <span class="sc">Lawson</span></i>). My good friend! Brodie, you might
have spared the old man this.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I might have spared him years ago; and you
and my sister, and myself. I might ... would God
I had! (<i>Weeping himself</i>.) Don&rsquo;t weep, my good
old friend; I was lost long since; don&rsquo;t think of
me; don&rsquo;t pity me; don&rsquo;t shame me with your pity!
I began this when I was a boy. I bound the millstone
round my neck; (it is irrevocable now), and
you must all suffer ... all suffer for me!... (for
this suffering remnant of what was once a man). O
God, that I can have fallen to stand here as I do now.
My friend lying to save me from the gallows; my
second father weeping tears of blood for my disgrace!
And all for what? Ay what? Because I had an
open hand, because I was a selfish dog, because I loved
this woman.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jean.</span> O Wullie, and she lo&rsquo;ed ye weel! But come near
me nae mair, come near me nae mair, my man; keep

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> You can do one thing still ... for Mary&rsquo;s sake.
You can save yourself; you must fly.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> It is my purpose; the day after to-morrow.
It cannot be before. Then I will fly; and O, as God
sees me, I will strive to make a new and a better life,
and to be worthy of your friendship, and of your
tears ... your tears. And to be worthy of you, too,
Jean; for I see now that the bandage has fallen from
my eyes; I see myself, O how unworthy even of you!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>73</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Why not to-night?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> It cannot be before. There are many considerations.
I must find money.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie</span> (<i>opening the strong-box and pouring gold upon the

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Not that ... not the money that I came to
steal!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lawson.</span> Tak&rsquo; it, William; I&rsquo;ll pay him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> It is in vain. I cannot leave till I have said.
There is a man; I must obey him. If I slip my chain
till he has done with me, the hue and cry will blaze
about the country; every outport will be shut; I shall
return to the gallows. He is a man that will stick at
nothing.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith</span> (<i>entering first</i>). Come on, coast clear.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore</span> (<i>after they have come to the front</i>). Ain&rsquo;t he turned
up yet?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith</span> (<i>to <span class="sc">Ainslie</span></i>). Now, Maggot! The fishing&rsquo;s a-going
to begin.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ainslie.</span> Dinna cangle, Geordie. My back&rsquo;s fair broke.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> O, muck! Hand out them pieces.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> All right, Humptious! (<i>To <span class="sc">Ainslie</span>.</i>) You&rsquo;re a
nice old sort for a rag-and-bone man: can&rsquo;t hold
a bag open! (<i>Taking out tools.</i>) Here they was. Here
are the bunchums, one and two; and jolly old keys
was they. Here&rsquo;s the picklocks, crowbars, and here&rsquo;s
Lord George&rsquo;s pet bull&rsquo;s-eye, his old and valued friend,
the Cracksman&rsquo;s Treasure!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>75</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Just like you. Forgot the rotten centre-bit.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> O, rot! Hand it over, and keep yourself out of

<p><span class="sc">Smith</span> (<i>lighting lantern</i>). All right, old mumble-peg. Don&rsquo;t
you get carried away by the fire of old Rome. That&rsquo;s
your motto. Here are the tools, a perfect picter
of the sublime and beautiful; and all I hope is that
our friend and pitcher, the Deakin, will make a better
job of it than he did last night. If he don&rsquo;t, I shall
retire from the business&mdash;that&rsquo;s all; and it&rsquo;ll be George
and his little wife and a black footman till death do
us part.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> O, muck! You&rsquo;re all jaw like a sheep&rsquo;s jimmy.
That&rsquo;s my opinion of you. When did you see him
last?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> This morning; and he looked as if he was rehearsing
for his own epitaph. I never see such a change in a
man. I gave him the office for to-night; and was he
grateful? Did he weep upon my faithful bosom?
No; he smiled upon me like a portrait of the dear
departed. I see his &rsquo;art was far away; and it broke
my own to look at him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> Muck! Wot I ses is, if a cove&rsquo;s got that much
of the nob about him, wot&rsquo;s the good of his working
single-handed? That&rsquo;s wot&rsquo;s the matter with him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Well, old Father Christmas, he ain&rsquo;t single-handed
to-night, is he?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> No, he ain&rsquo;t; he&rsquo;s got a man with him to-night.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith.</span> Pardon me, Romeo: two men, I think?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Moore.</span> A man wot means business. If I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; bin with
him last night, it ain&rsquo;t psalm-singin&rsquo; would have got
us off. Psalm-singin&rsquo;? Muck! Let &rsquo;em try it on
with me.</p>

now if there were not good cause?</p>

has happened ... to him! Walter...!
Is he ... dead?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> There are worse things in the world than death.
There is ... O Mary, he is your brother!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> What?... Dishonour!... The Deacon!...
My God!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> My wife, my wife!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> No, no! Keep away from me. Don&rsquo;t touch me.
I&rsquo;m not fit ... not fit to be near you. What has
he done? I am his sister. Tell me the worst. Tell
me the worst at once.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> That, if God wills, dear, you shall never know.
Whatever it be, think that I knew it all, and only
loved you better; think that your true husband is
with you, and you are not to bear it alone.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> My husband?... Never.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Mary...!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> You forget, you forget what I am. I am his
sister. I owe him a lifetime of happiness and love;
I owe him even you. And whatever his fault, however
ruinous his disgrace, he is my brother&mdash;my own
brother&mdash;and my place is still with him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Your place is with me&mdash;is with your husband.
With me, with me; and for his sake most of all. What
can you do for him alone? how can you help him
alone? It wrings my heart to think how little. But
together is different. Together...! Join my
strength, my will, my courage to your own, and together
we may save him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> All that is over. Once I was blessed among
women. I was my father&rsquo;s daughter, my brother
loved me, I lived to be your wife. Now...! My
father is dead, my brother is shamed; and you ...
O how could I face the world, how could I endure
myself, if I preferred my happiness to your honour?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> What is my honour but your happiness? In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>84</span>
what else does it consist? Is it in denying me my
heart? is it in visiting another&rsquo;s sin upon the innocent?
Could I do that, and be my mother&rsquo;s son? Could
I do that, and bear my father&rsquo;s name? Could I
do that, and have ever been found worthy of you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> It is my duty ... my duty. Why will you
make it so hard for me? So hard, Walter, so hard!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> Do I pursue you only for your good fortune,
your beauty, the credit of your friends, your family&rsquo;s
good name? That were not love, and I love you.
I love you, dearest, I love you. Friend, father, brother,
husband ... I must be all these to you. I am
a man who can love well.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Silence ... in pity! I cannot ... O, I
cannot bear it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> And say it was I who had fallen. Say I had
played my neck and lost it ... that I were pushed
by the law to the last limits of ignominy and despair.
Whose love would sanctify my gaol to me? whose
pity would shine upon me in the dock? whose prayers
would accompany me to the gallows? Whose but
yours? Yours!... And you would entreat me&mdash;me!&mdash;to
do what you shrink from even in thought,
what you would die ere you attempted in deed!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Walter ... on my knees ... no more,
no more!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> My wife! my wife! Here on my heart! It
is I that must kneel ... I that must kneel to you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Dearest!... Husband! You forgive him?
O, you forgive him?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie.</span> He is my brother now. Let me take you to our
father. Come.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> O ... the servant ... and the doctor.
Very true. Then it&rsquo;s all over the town by now. The
servant and the doctor. The doctor? What doctor?
Why the doctor?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> My father is dead. O Will, where have you been?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Your father is dead. O yes! He&rsquo;s dead, is

did you open the door? It&rsquo;s strange. I bolted it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> We could not help it, Will, now could we? The

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> We did it for the best; it was I who did it ...
I, your own sister. And O Will, my Willie, where
have you been? You have not been in any harm,
any danger?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Danger? O, my young lady, you have taken
care of that. It&rsquo;s not danger now, it&rsquo;s death. Death?
Ah! Death! Death! Death! (<i>Clutching the table.
Then recovering as from a dream.</i>) Death? Did you
say my father was dead? My father? O my God,
my poor old father! Is he dead, Mary? Have I
lost him? is he gone? O, Mary dear, and to think

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Dearest, he is in heaven.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Did he suffer?</p>

He knows now. He knows; he sees us now ...
sees me! Ay, and sees you left&mdash;how lonely!</p>

and believe I did not mean that it should come to
this; try and believe that I was only weak at first.
At first? And now! The good old man dead, the
kind sister ruined, the innocent boy fallen, fallen....
You will be quite alone; all your old friends, all the
old faces, gone into darkness. The night (<i>with a gesture</i>) ... it
waits for me. You will be quite alone.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> The night!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Mary, you must hear. How am I to tell her,
and the old man just dead! Mary, I was the boy
you knew; I loved pleasure, I was weak; I have
fallen ... low ... lower than you think.
A beginning is so small a thing! I never dreamed it
would come to this ... this hideous last night.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Willie, you must tell me, dear. I must have the
truth ... the kind truth ... at once ...
in pity.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Crime. I have fallen. Crime.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Crime?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Don&rsquo;t shrink from me. Miserable dog that I
am, selfish hound that has dragged you to this misery ... you
and all that loved him ... think
only of my torments, think only of my penitence, don&rsquo;t
shrink from me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> I do not care to hear, I do not wish, I do not
mind; you are my brother. What do I care? How
can I help you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Help? help <i>me</i>? You would not speak of
it, not wish it, if you knew. My kind good sister,
my little playmate, my sweet friend! Was I ever
unkind to you till yesterday? Not openly unkind?
You&rsquo;ll say that when I am gone.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> If you have done wrong, what do I care? If
you have failed, does it change my twenty years of
love and worship? Never!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>88</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>recoiling</i>). No, don&rsquo;t touch me, not a finger,
not that, anything but that!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Willie, Willie!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie</span> (<i>taking the bloody dagger from the table</i>). See,
do you understand that?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Ah! What, what is it!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Blood. I have killed a man.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> You?...</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> I am a murderer; I was a thief before. Your
brother ... the old man&rsquo;s only son!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Walter, Walter, come to me!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> Now you see that I must die; now you see
that I stand upon the grave&rsquo;s edge, all my lost life
behind me, like a horror to think upon, like a frenzy,
like a dream that is past. And you, you are alone.
Father, brother, they are gone from you; one to heaven,
one...!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mary.</span> Hush, dear, hush! Kneel, pray; it is not too
late to repent. Think of our father, dear; repent.
(<i>She weeps, straining to his bosom.</i>) O Willie, my
darling boy, repent and join us.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brodie.</span> No, Jean, this is where it ends. Uncle, this is

still had hopes! Hopes! Ay, not an hour ago
I thought of a new life. You were not forgotten, Jean.
Leslie, you must try to forgive me ... you too!</p>

<h5>PROLOGUE</h5>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;To all and singular,&rdquo; as Dryden says,</p>
<p>We bring a fancy of those Georgian days,</p>
<p>Whose style still breathed a faint and fine perfume</p>
<p>Of old-world courtliness and old-world bloom:</p>
<p>When speech was elegant and talk was fit,</p>
<p>For slang had not been canonised as wit;</p>
<p>When manners reigned, when breeding had the wall,</p>
<p>And Women&mdash;yes!&mdash;were ladies first of all;</p>
<p>When Grace was conscious of its gracefulness,</p>
<p>And man&mdash;though Man!&mdash;was not ashamed to dress.</p>
<p>A brave formality, a measured ease,</p>
<p>Were his&mdash;and hers&mdash;whose effort was to please.</p>
<p>And to excel in pleasing was to reign,</p>
<p>And, if you sighed, never to sigh in vain.</p>

<p class="stanza">But then, as now&mdash;it may be, something more&mdash;</p>
<p>Woman and man were human to the core.</p>
<p>The hearts that throbbed behind that quaint attire</p>
<p>Burned with a plenitude of essential fire.</p>
<p>They too could risk, they also could rebel.</p>
<p>They could love wisely&mdash;they could love too well.</p>
<p>In that great duel of Sex, that ancient strife</p>
<p>Which is the very central fact of life,</p>
<p>They could&mdash;and did&mdash;engage it breath for breath,</p>
<p>They could&mdash;and did&mdash;get wounded unto death.</p>
<p>As at all times since time for us began</p>
<p>Woman was truly woman, man was man.</p>
<p>And joy and sorrow were as much at home</p>
<p>In trifling Tunbridge as in mighty Rome.</p>

<p class="stanza">Dead&mdash;dead and done with! Swift from shine to shade</p>
<p>The roaring generations flit and fade.</p>
<p>To this one, fading, flitting, like the rest,</p>
<p>We come to proffer&mdash;be it worst or best&mdash;</p>
<p>A sketch, a shadow, of one brave old time;</p>
<p>A hint of what it might have held sublime;</p>
<p>A dream, an idyll, call it what you will,</p>
<p>Of man still Man, and woman&mdash;Woman still!</p>

<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<p class="ct"><i><span class="sc">Barbara</span>; to her, <span class="sc">Miss Foster</span></i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara</span> (<i>out of window</i>). Mr. Menteith! Mr. Menteith!
Mr. Menteith!&mdash;Drat his old head! Will nothing
make him hear?&mdash;Mr. Menteith!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster</span> (<i>entering</i>). Barbara! this is incredible:
after all my lessons, to be leaning from the window,
and calling (for unless my ears deceived me, you were
positively calling!) into the street.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> Well, madam, just wait until you hear who
it was. I declare it was much more for Miss Dorothy
and yourself than for me; and if it was a little countrified,
I had a good excuse.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Nonsense, child! At least, who was it?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> Miss Evelina, I was sure you would ask. Well,
what do you think? I was looking out of the window
at the barber&rsquo;s opposite&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Of which I entirely disapprove&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> And first there came out two of the most
beautiful&mdash;the Royal livery, madam!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Of course, of course: the Duke of York
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>100</span>
arrived last night. I trust you did not hail the Duke&rsquo;s
footmen?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> O no, madam, it was after they were gone.
Then, who should come out&mdash;but you&rsquo;ll never guess!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> I shall certainly not try.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> Mr. Menteith himself!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Why, child, I never heard of him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> O madam, not the Beau&rsquo;s own gentleman?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Mr. Austin&rsquo;s servant. No? Is it possible?
By that, George Austin must be here.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> No doubt of that, madam; they&rsquo;re never far
apart. He came out feeling his chin, madam, so;
and a packet of letters under his arm, so; and he
had the Beau&rsquo;s own walk to that degree you couldn&rsquo;t
tell his back from his master&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> My dear Barbara, you too frequently forget
yourself. A young woman in your position must
beware of levity.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> Madam, I know it; but la, what are you to
make of me? Look at the time and trouble dear
Miss Dorothy was always taking&mdash;she that trained
up everybody&mdash;and see what&rsquo;s come of it: Barbara
Ridley I was, and Barbara Ridley I am; and I don&rsquo;t
do with fashionable ways&mdash;I can&rsquo;t do with them;
and indeed, Miss Evelina, I do sometimes wish we
were all back again on Edenside, and Mr. Anthony
a boy again, and dear Miss Dorothy her old self, galloping
the bay mare along the moor, and taking care of all
of us as if she was our mother, bless her heart!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Miss Dorothy herself, child? Well, now
you mention it, Tunbridge of late has scarcely seemed
to suit her constitution. She falls away, has not a
word to throw at a dog, and is ridiculously pale. Well,
now Mr. Austin has returned, after six months of infidelity,
to the dear Wells, we shall all, I hope, be
brightened up. Has the mail come?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> That it has, madam, and the sight of Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"></a>101</span>
Menteith put it clean out of my head. (<i>With letters.</i>)
Four for you, Miss Evelina, two for me, and only one
for Miss Dorothy. Miss Dorothy seems quite neglected,
does she not? Six months ago, it was a different
story.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Well, and that&rsquo;s true, Barbara, and I had
not remarked it. I must take her seriously to task.
No young lady in her position should neglect her
correspondence. (<i>Opening a letter.</i>) Here&rsquo;s from that
dear ridiculous boy, the Cornet, announcing his arrival
for to-day.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> O madam, will he come in his red coat?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> I could not conceive him missing such a
chance. Youth, child, is always vain, and Mr. Anthony
is unusually young.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> La, madam, he can&rsquo;t help that.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> My child, I am not so sure. Mr. Anthony
is a great concern to me. He was orphaned, to be
sure, at ten years old; and ever since he has been only
as it were his sister&rsquo;s son. Dorothy did everything
for him: more indeed than I thought quite ladylike,
but I suppose I begin to be old-fashioned. See how
she worked and slaved&mdash;yes, slaved!&mdash;for him: teaching
him herself, with what pains and patience she only
could reveal, and learning that she might be able;
and see what he is now: a gentleman, of course, but,
to be frank, a very commonplace one: not what I
had hoped of Dorothy&rsquo;s brother; not what I had
dreamed of the heir of two families&mdash;Musgrave and
Foster, child! Well, he may now meet Mr. Austin.
He requires a Mr. Austin to embellish and correct his
manners. (<i>Opening another letter.</i>) Why, Barbara,
Mr. John Scrope and Miss Kate Dacre are to be married!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> La, madam, how nice!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> They are: as I&rsquo;m a sinful woman. And
when will you be married, Barbara? and when dear
Dorothy? I hate to see old maids a-making.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>102</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> La, Miss Evelina, there&rsquo;s no harm in an old
maid.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> You speak like a fool, child: sour grapes
are all very well, but it&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s business to be
married. As for Dorothy, she is five-and-twenty,
and she breaks my heart. Such a match, too! Ten
thousand to her fortune, the best blood in the north,
a most advantageous person, all the graces, the finest
sensibility, excellent judgment, the Foster walk;
and all these go positively a-begging! The men
seem stricken with blindness. Why, child, when I
came out (and I was the dear girl&rsquo;s image!) I had
more swains at my feet in a fortnight than our Dorothy
in&mdash;&mdash;O, I cannot fathom it: it must be the girl&rsquo;s
own fault.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> Why, madam, I did think it was a case with
Mr. Austin.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> With Mr. Austin? why, how very rustic!
The attentions of a gentleman like Mr. Austin, child,
are not supposed to lead to matrimony. He is a
feature of society: an ornament: a personage: a
private gentleman by birth, but a kind of king by
habit and reputation. What woman could he marry?
Those to whom he might properly aspire are all too
far below him. I have known George Austin too
long, child, and I understand that the very greatness
of his success condemns him to remain unmarried.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> Sure, madam, that must be tiresome for him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Some day, child, you will know better
than to think so. George Austin, as I conceive him,
and as he is regarded by the world, is one of the triumphs
of the other sex. I walked my first minuet with
him: I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you the year, child, for worlds;
but it was soon after his famous encounter with Colonel
Villiers. He had killed his man, he wore pink and
silver, was most elegantly pale, and the most ravishing
creature!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>103</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> Well, madam, I believe that: he is the most
beautiful gentleman still.</p>






<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE II</h4>

<p class="ct"><i>To these, <span class="sc">Dorothy</span>, L.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy</span> (<i>entering</i>). Good-morning, aunt! Is there anything
for me? (<i>She goes eagerly to table and looks at
letters.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Good-morrow, niece. Breakfast, Barbara.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy</span> (<i>with letter unopened</i>). Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> And what do you call that, my dear?
(<i>Sitting.</i>) Is John Fenwick nobody?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy</span> (<i>looking at letter</i>). From John?  O yes, so it
is. (<i>Lays letter down unopened, and sits to breakfast,
<span class="sc">Barbara</span> waiting.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster</span> (<i>to <span class="sc">Barbara</span>, with plate</i>). Thanks, child;
now you may give me some tea. Dolly, I must insist
on your eating a good breakfast: I cannot away
with your pale cheeks and that Patience-on-a-Monument
kind of look. (Toast, Barbara!) At Edenside you
ate and drank and looked like Hebe. What have
you done with your appetite?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> I don&rsquo;t know, aunt, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Then consider, please, and recover it as
soon as you can: to a young lady in your position a
good appetite is an attraction&mdash;almost a virtue. Do
you know that your brother arrives this morning?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Dear Anthony! Where is his letter, Aunt
Evelina? I am pleased that he should leave London
and its perils, if only for a day.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> My dear, there are moments when you
positively amaze me. (Barbara, some <i>pâté</i>, if you
please!) I beg you not to be a prude. All women,
of course, are virtuous; but a prude is something I
regard with abhorrence. The Cornet is seeing life, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>104</span>
is exactly what he wanted. You brought him up
surprisingly well; I have always admired you for it;
but let us admit&mdash;as women of the world, my dear&mdash;it
was no upbringing for a man. You and that fine
solemn fellow, John Fenwick, led a life that was positively
no better than the Middle Ages; and between
the two of you poor Anthony (who, I am sure, was a
most passive creature!) was so packed with principle
and admonition that I vow and declare he reminded me
of Issachar stooping between his two burdens. It was
high time for him to be done with your apron-string,
my dear: he has all his wild oats to sow; and that
is an occupation which it is unwise to defer too long.
By the bye, have you heard the news? The Duke
of York has done us a service for which I was unprepared.
(More tea, Barbara!) George Austin,
bringing the prince in his train, is with us once more.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> I knew he was coming.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> You knew, child? and did not tell? You
are a public criminal.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> I did not think it mattered, Aunt Evelina.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> O do not make-believe. I am in love
with him myself, and have been any time since Nelson
and the Nile. As for you, Dolly, since he went away
six months ago, you have been positively in the megrims.
I shall date your loss of appetite from George Austin&rsquo;s
vanishing. No, my dear, our family require entertainment:
we must have wit about us, and beauty, and
the <i>bel air</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> Well, Miss Dorothy, perhaps it&rsquo;s out of my
place: but I do hope Mr. Austin will come: I should
love to have him see my necklace on.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Necklace? what necklace? Did he give you
a necklace?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> Yes, indeed, Miss, that he did; the very
same day he drove you in his curricle to Penshurst.
You remember, Miss, I couldn&rsquo;t go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>105</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> I remember.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> And so do I. I had a touch of ...
Foster in the blood: the family gout, dears!...
And you, you ungrateful nymph, had him a whole
day to yourself, and not a word to tell me when you
returned.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> I remember. (<i>Rising.</i>) Is that the necklace,
Barbara? It does not suit you. Give it me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> La, Miss Dorothy, I wouldn&rsquo;t for the world.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Come, give it me. I want it. Thank you:
you shall have my birthday pearls instead.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Why, Dolly, I believe you&rsquo;re jealous of the
maid. Foster, Foster: always a Foster trick to wear
the willow in anger.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> I do not think, madam, that I am of a jealous
habit.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> O, the personage is your excuse! And
I can tell you, child, that when George Austin was
playing Florizel to the Duchess&rsquo;s Perdita, all the maids
in England fell a prey to green-eyed melancholy.
It was the <i>ton</i>, you see: not to pine for that Sylvander
was to resign from good society.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Aunt Evelina, stop; I cannot endure to hear
you. What is he after all but just Beau Austin?
What has he done&mdash;with half a century of good health,
what has he done that is either memorable or worthy?
Diced and danced and set fashions; vanquished
in a drawing-room, fought for a word; what else?
As if these were the meaning of life! Do not make
me think so poorly of all of us women. Sure, we
can rise to admire a better kind of man than Mr.
Austin. We are not all to be snared with the eye,
dear aunt; and those that are&mdash;O! I know not whether
I more hate or pity them.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> You will give me leave, my niece: such
talk is neither becoming in a young lady nor creditable
to your understanding. The world was made a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>106</span>
while before Miss Dorothy Musgrave; and you will
do much better to ripen your opinions, and in the
meantime read your letter, which I perceive you have
not opened. (<i><span class="sc">Dorothy</span> opens and reads letter.</i>) Barbara,
child, you should not listen at table.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> Sure, madam, I hope I know my place.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Then do not do it again.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Poor John Fenwick! he coming here!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Well, and why not? Dorothy, my darling
child, you give me pain. You never had but one
chance, let me tell you pointedly; and that was John
Fenwick. If I were you, I would not let my vanity so
blind me. This is not the way to marry.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Dear aunt, I shall never marry.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> A fiddlestick&rsquo;s end! every one must marry.
(<i>Rising.</i>) Are you for the Pantiles?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Not to-day, dear.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Well, well! have your wish, Dolorosa.&mdash;Barbara,
attend and dress me.</p>






<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE III</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> How she tortures me, poor aunt, my poor
blind aunt; and I&mdash;I could break her heart with a
word. That she should see nothing, know nothing&mdash;there&rsquo;s
where it kills. O, it is more than I can
bear ... and yet, how much less than I deserve!
Mad girl, of what do I complain? that this dear
innocent woman still believes me good, still pierces
me to the soul with trustfulness. Alas, and were it
otherwise, were her dear eyes opened to the truth,
what were left me but death?&mdash;He, too&mdash;she must
still be praising him, and every word is a lash upon
my conscience. If I could die of my secret: if I
could cease&mdash;but one moment cease&mdash;this living lie;
if I could sleep and forget and be at rest!&mdash;Poor John!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>107</span>
(<i>reading the letter</i>) he at least is guiltless; and yet
for my fault he too must suffer, he too must bear part
in my shame. Poor John Fenwick! Has he come
back with the old story: with what might have been,
perhaps, had we stayed by Edenside? Eden? yes,
my Eden, from which I fell. O, my old north country,
my old river&mdash;the river of my innocence, the old
country of my hopes&mdash;how could I endure to look
on you now? And how to meet John?&mdash;John, with
the old love on his lips, the old, honest, innocent,
faithful heart! There was a Dorothy once who was not
unfit to ride with him, her heart as light as his, her
life as clear as the bright rivers we forded; he called
her his Diana, he crowned her so with rowan. Where
is that Dorothy now? that Diana? she that was
everything to John? For O, I did him good; I know
I did him good; I will still believe I did him good:
I made him honest and kind and a true man; alas,
and could not guide myself! And now, how will he
despise me! For he shall know; if I die, he shall
know all; I could not live, and not be true with him.
(<i>She takes out the necklace and looks at it.</i>) That he
should have bought me from my maid! George,
George, that you should have stooped to this! Basely
as you have used me, this is the basest. Perish the
witness. (<i>She treads the trinket under foot.</i>) Break,
break like my heart, break like my hopes, perish like
my good name!</p>

<h4>SCENE IV</h4>

<p class="ct"><i>To her, <span class="sc">Fenwick</span>, C.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick</span> (<i>after a pause</i>). Is this how you receive me,
Dorothy? Am I not welcome?&mdash;Shall I go then?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy</span> (<i>running to him, with hands outstretched</i>). O no,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>108</span>
John, not for me. (<i>Turning and pointing to the necklace.</i>)
But you find me changed.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick</span> (<i>with a movement towards the necklace</i>). This?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> No, no, let it lie. That is a trinket&mdash;broken.
But the old Dorothy is dead.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Dead, dear? Not to me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Dead to you&mdash;dead to all men.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Dorothy, I loved you as a boy. There is
not a meadow on Edenside but is dear to me for your
sake, not a cottage but recalls your goodness, not a
rock nor a tree but brings back something of the best
and brightest youth man ever had. You were my
teacher and my queen; I walked with you, I talked
with you, I rode with you; I lived in your shadow;
I saw with your eyes. You will never know, dear
Dorothy, what you were to the dull boy you bore
with; you will never know with what romance you
filled my life, with what devotion, with what tenderness
and honour. At night I lay awake and worshipped
you; in my dreams I saw you, and you loved me;
and you remember, when we told each other stories&mdash;you
have not forgotten, dearest&mdash;that Princess Hawthorn
that was still the heroine of mine: who was she?
I was not bold enough to tell, but she was you! You,
my virgin huntress, my Diana, my queen.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> O silence, silence&mdash;pity!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> No, dear; neither for your sake nor mine
will I be silenced. I have begun; I must go on and
finish, and put fortune to the touch. It was from you
I learned honour, duty, piety, and love. I am as
you made me, and I exist but to reverence and serve
you. Why else have I come here, the length of England,
my heart burning higher every mile, my very horse
a clog to me?&mdash;why, but to ask you for my wife?
Dorothy, you will not deny me?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> You have not asked me about this broken
trinket?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>109</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Why should I ask? I love you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Yet I must tell you. Sit down. (<i>She picks
up the necklace, and stands looking at it. Then, breaking
down.</i>) O John, John, it&rsquo;s long since I left home.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Too long, dear love. The very trees will
welcome you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Ay, John, but I no longer love you. The old
Dorothy is dead, God pardon her!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Dorothy, who is the man?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> O poor Dorothy! O poor dead Dorothy!
John, you found me breaking this: me, your Diana
of the Fells, the Diana of your old romance by Edenside.
Diana&mdash;O what a name for me! Do you see this
trinket? It is a chapter in my life. A chapter, do I
say? my whole life, for there is none to follow. John,
you must bear with me, you must help me. I have
that to tell&mdash;there is a secret&mdash;I have a secret, John&mdash;O,
for God&rsquo;s sake, understand. That Diana you
revered&mdash;O John, John, you must never speak of love
to me again.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> What do you say? How dare you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> John, it is the truth. Your Diana, even she,
she whom you believed in, she who so believed in herself,
came out into the world only to be broken. I met,
here at the Wells, a man&mdash;why should I tell you his
name? I met him, and I loved him. My heart
was all his own; yet he was not content with that:
he must intrigue to catch me, he must bribe my maid
with this. (<i>Throws the necklace on the table.</i>) Did he
love me? Well, John, he said he did; and be it so!
He loved, he betrayed, and he has left me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Betrayed?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Ay, even so; I was betrayed. The fault
was mine that I forgot our innocent youth, and your
honest love.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Dorothy, O Dorothy!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Yours is the pain; but, O John, think it is for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>110</span>
your good. Think in England how many true maids
may be waiting for your love, how many that can
bring you a whole heart, and be a noble mother to your
children, while your poor Diana, at the first touch, has
proved all frailty. Go, go and be happy, and let me
be patient. I have sinned.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> By God, I&rsquo;ll have his blood.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Stop! I love him. (<i>Between <span class="sc">Fenwick</span> and
door, C.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> What do I care? I loved you too. Little he
thought of that, little either of you thought of that.
His blood&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have his blood!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> You shall never know his name.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Know it? Do you think I cannot guess?
Do you think I had not heard he followed you? Do
you think I had not suffered&mdash;O, suffered! George
Austin is the man. Dear shall he pay it!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy</span> (<i>at his feet</i>). Pity me; spare me; spare your
Dorothy! I love him&mdash;love him&mdash;love him!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Dorothy, you have robbed me of my happiness,
and now you would rob me of my revenge.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> I know it; and shall I ask, and you not grant?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick</span> (<i>raising her</i>). No, Dorothy, you shall ask nothing,
nothing in vain from me. You ask his life; I give
it you, as I would give you my soul; as I would give
you my life, if I had any left. My life is done; you
have taken it. Not a hope, not an end; not even
revenge. (<i>He sits.</i>) Dorothy, you see your work.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> O God, forgive me!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Ay, Dorothy, He will, as I do.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> As you do? Do you forgive me, John?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Ay, more than that, poor soul. I said my life
was done, I was wrong; I have still a duty. It is not
in vain you taught me; I shall still prove to you that
it was not in vain. You shall soon find that I am no
backward friend. Farewell.</p>

<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Austin, Menteith</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> At the barber&rsquo;s, Mr. George, I had the pleasure
of meeting two of the Dook&rsquo;s gentlemen.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Well, and was his Royal Highness satisfied with
his quarters?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> Quite so, Mr. George. Delighted, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> I am rejoiced to hear it. I wish I could say I was
as pleased with my journey, Menteith. This is the
first time I ever came to the Wells in another person&rsquo;s
carriage; Duke or not, it shall be the last, Menteith.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> Ah, Mr. George, no wonder. And how many
times have we made that journey back and forth?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Enough to make us older than we look.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> To be sure, Mr. George, you do wear well.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> <i>We</i> wear well, Menteith.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> I hear, Mr. George, that Miss Musgrave is of
the company.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Is she so? Well, well! well, well!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> I&rsquo;ve not seen the young lady myself, Mr.
George; but the barber tells me she&rsquo;s looking poorly.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Poorly?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>112</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> Yes, Mr. George, poorly was his word.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Well, Menteith, I am truly sorry. She is not
the first.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> Yes, Mr. George.</p>

<p>(<i>A bell. <span class="sc">Menteith</span> goes out and re-enters with

<p><span class="sc">Austin</span> (<i>with card</i>). Whom have we here? Anthony
Musgrave?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> A fine young man, Mr. George; and with
a look of the young lady, but not so gentlemanly.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> You have an eye, you have an eye. Let him
in.</p>






<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE II</h4>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Austin, Menteith, Anthony</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> I am charmed to have this opportunity, Mr.
Musgrave. You belong to my old corps, I think?
And how does my good friend, Sir Frederick? I
had his line; but, like all my old comrades, he thinks
last about himself, and gives me not of his news.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> I protest, sir, this is a very proud moment.
Your name is still remembered in the regiment.
(<i><span class="sc">Austin</span> bows.</i>) The Colonel&mdash;he keeps his health,
sir, considering his age (<i><span class="sc">Austin</span> bows again and looks
at <span class="sc">Menteith</span></i>)&mdash;tells us young men you were a devil
of a fellow in your time.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> I believe I was&mdash;in my time. Menteith, give
Mr. Musgrave a dish of chocolate. So, sir, we see
you at the Wells.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> I have but just alighted. I had but one
thought, sir: to pay my respects to Mr. Austin. I
have not yet kissed my aunt and sister.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> In my time&mdash;to which you refer&mdash;the ladies
had come first.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> The women? I take you, sir. But then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"></a>113</span>
you see, a man&rsquo;s relatives don&rsquo;t count. And besides,
Mr. Austin, between men of the world, I am fairly
running away from the sex: I am positively in flight.
Little Hortense of the Opera; you know; she sent
her love to you. She&rsquo;s mad about me, I think. You
never saw a creature so fond.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Well, well, child! you are better here. In my
time&mdash;to which you have referred&mdash;I knew the lady.
Does she wear well?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> I beg your pardon, sir!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> No offence, child, no offence. She was a very
lively creature. But you neglect your chocolate, I
see?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> We don&rsquo;t patronise it, Mr. Austin; we haven&rsquo;t
for some years: the service has quite changed since
your time. You&rsquo;d be surprised.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Doubtless. I am.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> I assure you, sir, I and Jack Bosbury of the
Fifty-second&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> The Hampshire Bosburys?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> I do not know exactly, sir. I believe he is
related.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Or perhaps&mdash;I remember a Mr. Bosbury, a
cutter of coats. I have the vanity to believe I formed
his business.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> I&mdash;I hope not, sir. But as I was saying, I
and this Jack Bosbury, and the Brummagem Bantam&mdash;a
very pretty light-weight, sir&mdash;drank seven bottles of
Burgundy to the three of us inside the eighty minutes.
Jack, sir, was a little cut; but me and the Bantam
went out and finished the evening on hot gin. Life,
sir, life! Tom Cribb was with us. He spoke of
you, too, Tom did: said you&rsquo;d given him a wrinkle for
his second fight with the black man. No, sir, I assure
you, you&rsquo;re not forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin</span> (<i>bows</i>). I am pleased to learn it. In my time,
I had an esteem for Mr. Cribb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>114</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> O come, sir! but your time cannot be said
to be over.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Menteith, you hear!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> Yes, Mr. George.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> The Colonel told me that you liked to shake
an elbow. Your big main, sir, with Lord Wensleydale,
is often talked about. I hope I may have the
occasion to sit down with you. I shall count it an
honour, I assure you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> But would your aunt, my very good friend,
approve?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Why, sir, you do not suppose I am in leading-strings?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> You forget, child: a family must hang together.
When I was young&mdash;in my time&mdash;I was alone; and
what I did concerned myself. But a youth who has&mdash;as
I think you have&mdash;a family of ladies to protect,
must watch his honour, child, and preserve his fortune....
You have no commands from Sir
Frederick?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> None, sir, none.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Shall I find you this noon upon the Pantiles?...
I shall be charmed. Commend me to your
aunt and your fair sister. Menteith?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> Yes, Mr. George. (<i>Shows <span class="sc">Anthony</span> out.</i>)</p>

<h4>SCENE IV</h4>

<p class="ct"><i><span class="sc">Austin</span>, R. To him, <span class="sc">Menteith</span> and <span class="sc">Fenwick</span></i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith</span> (<i>announcing</i>). Mr. Fenwick, Mr. George.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> At the name of Miss Musgrave, my doors fly
always open.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> I believe, sir, you are acquainted with my
cousin, Richard Gaunt?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>116</span>
<span class="sc">Austin.</span> The county member? An old and good friend.
But you need not go so far afield: I know your good
house of Allonby Shaw since the days of the Black
Knight. We are, in fact, and at a very royal distance,
cousins.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> I desired, sir, from the nature of my business,
that you should recognise me for a gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> The preliminary, sir, is somewhat grave.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> My business is both grave and delicate.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Menteith, my good fellow. (<i>Exit <span class="sc">Menteith</span>.</i>)
Mr. Fenwick, honour me so far as to be seated. (<i>They
sit.</i>) I await your pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Briefly, sir, I am come, not without hope, to
appeal to your good heart.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> From Miss Musgrave?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> No, sir, I abused her name, and am here upon
my own authority. Upon me the consequence.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Proceed.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Mr. Austin, Dorothy Musgrave is the oldest
and dearest of my friends; is the lady whom for ten
years it has been my hope to make my wife. She
has shown me reason to discard that hope for another:
that I may call her Mrs. Austin.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> In the best interests of the lady (<i>rising</i>) I question
if you have been well inspired. You are aware, sir,
that from such interference there is but one issue: to
whom shall I address my friend?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Mr. Austin, I am here to throw myself upon
your mercy. Strange as my errand is, it will seem
yet more strange to you that I came prepared to accept
at your hands any extremity of dishonour and not
fight. The lady whom it is my boast to serve has
honoured me with her commands. These are my law,
and by these your life is sacred.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Then, sir (<i>with his hand upon the bell</i>), this
conversation becomes impossible. You have me at
too gross a disadvantage; and, as you are a gentleman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>117</span>
and respect another, I would suggest that you
retire.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Sir, you speak of disadvantage; think of
mine. All my life long, with all the forces of my
nature, I have loved this lady. I came here to implore
her to be my wife, to be my queen; my saint she had
been always! She was too noble to deceive me. She told
me what you know. I will not conceal that my first
mood was of anger: I would have killed you like a dog.
But, Mr. Austin&mdash;bear with me a while&mdash;I, on the threshold
of my life, who have made no figure in the world, nor
ever shall now, who had but one treasure, and have lost
it&mdash;if I, abandoning revenge, trampling upon jealousy,
can supplicate you to complete my misfortune&mdash;O
Mr. Austin! you who have lived, you whose gallantry
is beyond the insolence of a suspicion, you who are
a man crowned and acclaimed, who are loved, and
loved by such a woman&mdash;you who excel me in every
point of advantage, will you suffer me to surpass you
in generosity?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> You speak from the heart. (<i>Sits.</i>) What do
you want with me?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Marry her.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Mr. Fenwick, I am the older man. I have seen
much of life, much of society, much of love. When
I was young, it was expected of a gentleman to be
ready with his hat to a lady, ready with his sword to
a man; to honour his word and his king; to be courteous
with his equals, generous to his dependants, helpful
and trusty in friendship. But it was not asked of us
to be quixotic. If I had married every lady by whom
it is my fortune&mdash;not my merit&mdash;to have been distinguished,
the Wells would scarce be spacious enough
for my establishment. You see, sir, that while I respect
your emotion, I am myself conducted by experience.
And besides, Mr. Fenwick, is not love a warfare? has
it not rules? have not our fair antagonists their tactics,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>118</span>
their weapons, their place of arms? and is there not
a touch of&mdash;pardon me the word! of silliness in one
who, having fought and having vanquished, sounds a
parley, and capitulates to his own prisoner? Had the
lady chosen, had the fortune of war been other, &rsquo;tis
like she had been Mrs. Austin. Now!... You
know the world.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> I know, sir, that the world contains much
cowardice. To find Mr. Austin afraid to do the right,
this surprises me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Afraid, child?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Yes, sir, afraid. You know her, you know
if she be worthy; and you answer me with&mdash;the world:
the world which has been at your feet: the world which
Mr. Austin knows so well how to value and is so able
to rule.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> I have lived long enough, Mr. Fenwick, to recognise
that the world is a great power. It can make;
but it can break.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Sir, suffer me: you spoke but now of friendship,
and spoke warmly. Have you forgotten Colonel
Villiers?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Mr. Fenwick, Mr. Fenwick, you forget what I
have suffered.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> O sir, I know you loved him. And yet, for
a random word you quarrelled; friendship was weighed
in vain against the world&rsquo;s code of honour; you fought,
and your friend fell. I have heard from others how he
lay long in agony, and how you watched and nursed him,
and it was in your embrace he died. In God&rsquo;s name,
have you forgotten that? Was not this sacrifice enough,
or must the world, once again, step between Mr. Austin
and his generous heart?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Good God, sir, I believe you are in the right;
I believe, upon my soul I believe, there is something
in what you say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>119</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Something, Mr. Austin? O credit me, the
whole difference betwixt good and evil.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Nay, nay, but there you go too far. There are
many kinds of good; honour is a diamond cut in a
thousand facets, and with the true fire in each. Thus,
and with all our differences, Mr. Fenwick, you and I
can still respect, we can still admire each other.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Bear with me still, sir, if I ask you what is
the end of life but to excel in generosity? To pity
the weak, to comfort the afflicted, to right where
we have wronged, to be brave in reparation&mdash;these
noble elements you have; for of what besides is the
fabric of your dealing with Colonel Villiers? That
is man&rsquo;s chivalry to man. Yet to a suffering woman&mdash;a
woman feeble, betrayed, unconsoled&mdash;you deny
your clemency, you refuse your aid, you proffer injustice
for atonement. Nay, you are so disloyal to
yourself that you can choose to be ungenerous and
unkind. Where, sir, is the honour? What facet of
the diamond is that?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> You forget, sir, you forget. But go on.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> O sir, not I&mdash;not I but yourself forgets:
George Austin forgets George Austin. A woman
loved by him, betrayed by him, abandoned by him&mdash;that
woman suffers; and a point of honour keeps
him from his place at her feet. She has played and
lost, and the world is with him if he deign to exact
the stakes. Is that the Mr. Austin whom Miss Musgrave
honoured with her trust? Then, sir, how
miserably was she deceived!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Child&mdash;child&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Mr. Austin, still bear with me, still follow me.
O sir, will you not picture that dear lady&rsquo;s life? Her
years how few, her error thus irreparable, what henceforth
can be her portion but remorse, the consciousness
of self-abasement, the shame of knowing that her trust
was ill-bestowed? To think of it: this was a queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>120</span>
among women; and this&mdash;this is George Austin&rsquo;s
work! Sir, let me touch your heart: let me prevail
with you to feel that &rsquo;tis impossible.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> I am a gentleman. What do you ask of me?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> To be the man she loved: to be clement
where the world would have you triumph, to be of
equal generosity with the vanquished, to be worthy
of her sacrifice and of yourself.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Mr. Fenwick, your reproof is harsh&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick</span> (<i>interrupting him</i>). O sir, be just, be just!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> But it is merited, and I thank you for its utterance.
You tell me that the true victory comes when
the fight is won: that our foe is never so noble nor so
dangerous as when she is fallen, that the crowning
triumph is that we celebrate over our conquering selves.
Sir, you are right. Kindness, ay, kindness, after all.
And with age, to become clement. Yes, ambition first;
then, the rounded vanity&mdash;victory still novel; and last,
as you say, the royal mood of the mature man; to
abdicate for others.... Sir, you touched me hard
about my dead friend; still harder about my living
duty; and I am not so young but I can take a lesson.
There is my hand upon it: she shall be my wife.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Ah, Mr. Austin, I was sure of it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Then, sir, you were vastly mistaken. There
is nothing of Beau Austin here. I have simply, my
dear child, sate at the feet of Mr. Fenwick.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Ah, sir, your heart was counsellor enough.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Pardon me. I am vain enough to be the judge:
there are but two people in the world who could have
wrought this change: yourself and that dear lady.
(<i>Touches bell.</i>) Suffer me to dismiss you. One instant
of toilet, and I follow. Will you do me the honour to go
before, and announce my approach? (<i>Enter <span class="sc">Menteith</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Sir, if my admiration&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Dear child, the admiration is the other way.
(<i>Embraces him. <span class="sc">Menteith</span> shows him out</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Upon my word, I think the world is getting
better. We were none of us young men like that&mdash;in
my time&mdash;to quote my future brother. (<i>He sits
down before the mirror.</i>) Well, here ends Beau Austin.
Paris, Rome, Vienna, London&mdash;victor everywhere:
and now he must leave his bones in Tunbridge Wells.
(<i>Looks at his leg.</i>) Poor Dolly Musgrave! a good girl
after all, and will make me a good wife; none better.
The last&mdash;of how many?&mdash;ay, and the best! Walks
like Hebe. But still, here ends Beau Austin. Perhaps
it&rsquo;s time. Poor Dolly&mdash;was she looking poorly? She
shall have her wish. Well, we grow older, but we grow
no worse.</p>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Austin, Menteith</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Menteith, I am going to be married.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> Well, Mr. George, but I am pleased to hear it.
Miss Musgrave is a most elegant lady.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Ay, Mr. Menteith; and who told you the lady&rsquo;s
name?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> Mr. George, you was always a gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> You mean I wasn&rsquo;t always? Old boy, you are
in the right. This shall be a good change for both
you and me. We have lived too long like a brace
of truants: now is the time to draw about the fire.
How much is left of the old Hermitage?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> Hard upon thirty dozen, Mr. George, and
not a bad cork in the bin.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> And a mistress, Menteith, that&rsquo;s worthy of that
wine.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> Mr. George, sir, she&rsquo;s worthy of you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>122</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Gad, I believe it. (<i>Shakes hands with him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith</span> (<i>breaking down</i>). Mr. George, you&rsquo;ve been
a damned good master to me, and I&rsquo;ve been a damned
good servant to you; we&rsquo;ve been proud of each other
from the first; but if you&rsquo;ll excuse my plainness, Mr.
George, I never liked you better than to-day.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Cheer up, old boy, the best is yet to come. Get
out the tongs, and curl me like a bridegroom. (<i>Sits

<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<p class="ct"><i><span class="sc">Dorothy</span>, R., at tambour; <span class="sc">Anthony</span>, C., bestriding
chair; <span class="sc">Miss Foster</span>, L.C.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Yes, ma&rsquo;am, I like my regiment: we are all
gentlemen, from old Fred downwards, and all of a
good family. Indeed, so are all my friends, except
one tailor sort of fellow, Bosbury. But I&rsquo;m done
with him. I assure you, Aunt Evelina, we are Corinthian
to the last degree. I wouldn&rsquo;t shock you ladies
for the world&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Don&rsquo;t mind me, my dear; go on.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Really, ma&rsquo;am, you must pardon me: I trust
I understand what topics are to be avoided among
females&mdash;and before my sister, too! A girl of her age!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Why, you dear, silly fellow, I&rsquo;m old enough to
be your mother.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> My dear Dolly, you do not understand; you
are not a man of the world. But, as I was going on to
say, there is no more spicy regiment in the service.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> I am not surprised that it maintains its old
reputation. You know, my dear (<i>to <span class="sc">Dorothy</span></i>), it was
George Austin&rsquo;s regiment.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Was it, aunt?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Beau Austin? Yes, it was; and a precious
dust they make about him still&mdash;a parcel of old frumps!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>124</span>
That&rsquo;s why I went to see him. But he&rsquo;s quite extinct:
he couldn&rsquo;t be Corinthian if he tried.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> I am afraid that even at your age George
Austin held a very different position from the distinguished
Anthony Musgrave.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Come, ma&rsquo;am, I take that unkindly. Of
course I know what you&rsquo;re at: of course the old put
cut no end of a dash with the Duchess.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> My dear child, I was thinking of no such
thing; <i>that</i> was immoral.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Then you mean that affair at Brighton: when
he cut the Prince about Perdita Robinson.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> No, I had forgotten it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> O, well, I know&mdash;that duel! But look here,
Aunt Evelina, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d be much gratified
after all if I were to be broke for killing my commanding
officer about a quarrel at cards.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Nobody asks you, Anthony, to imitate Mr.
Austin. I trust you will set yourself a better model.
But you may choose a worse. With all his faults, and
all his enemies, Mr. Austin is a pattern gentleman.
You would not ask a man to be braver, and there are
few so generous. I cannot bear to hear him called in
fault by one so young. Better judges, dear, are better
pleased.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Hey-day! what&rsquo;s this?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Why, Dolly, this is April and May. You
surprise me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> I am afraid, indeed, madam, that you have
much to suffer from my caprice. (<i>She goes out, L.</i>)</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>125</span></p>





<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE II</h4>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Anthony, Miss Foster</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> What is the meaning of all this, ma&rsquo;am? I
don&rsquo;t like it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Nothing, child, that I know. You spoke
of Mr. Austin, our dear friend, like a groom; and she,
like any lady of taste, took arms in his defence.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> No, ma&rsquo;am, that won&rsquo;t do. I know the sex.
You mark my words, the girl has some confounded nonsense
in her head, and wants looking after.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> In my presence, Anthony, I shall ask you
to speak of Dorothy with greater respect. With your
permission, your sister and I will continue to direct
our own affairs. When we require the interference of
so young and confident a champion, you shall know.
(<i>Curtsies, kisses her hand and goes out, L.</i>)</p>





<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE III</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Upon my word, I think Aunt Evelina one
of the most uncivil old women in the world. Nine
weeks ago I came of age; and they still treat me
like a boy. I&rsquo;m a recognised Corinthian, too: take
my liquor with old Fred, and go round with the Brummagem
Bantam and Jack Bosb&mdash;&mdash;.... O, damn
Jack Bosbury. If his father was a tailor, he shall fight
me for his ungentlemanly conduct. However, that&rsquo;s
all one. What I want is to make Aunt Evelina understand
that I&rsquo;m not the man to be put down by an
old maid who&rsquo;s been brought up in a work-basket,
begad! I&rsquo;ve had nothing but rebuffs all day. It&rsquo;s
very remarkable. There was that man Austin, to
begin with. I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I can stand him. I
hear too much of him; and if I can only get a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"></a>126</span>
excuse to put him to the door, I believe it would give
Dorothy and all of us a kind of a position. After all,
he&rsquo;s not a man to visit in the house of ladies: not
when I&rsquo;m away, at least. Nothing in it, of course;
but is he a man whose visits I can sanction?</p>




<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE IV</h4>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Anthony, Barbara</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> Please, Mr. Anthony, Miss Foster said I was
to show your room.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Ah! Baby? Now, you come here. You&rsquo;re
a girl of sense, I know.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> La, Mr. Anthony, I hope I&rsquo;m nothing of the
kind.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Come, come! that&rsquo;s not the tone I want:
I&rsquo;m serious. Does this man Austin come much about
the house?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> O Mr. Anthony, for shame! Why don&rsquo;t you
ask Miss Foster?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Now I wish you to understand: I&rsquo;m the head
of this family. It&rsquo;s my business to look after my
sister&rsquo;s reputation, and my aunt&rsquo;s too, begad! That&rsquo;s
what I&rsquo;m here for: I&rsquo;m their natural protector. And
what I want you, Barbara Ridley, to understand&mdash;you
whose fathers have served my fathers&mdash;is just
simply this: if you&rsquo;ve any common gratitude, you&rsquo;re
bound to help me in the work. Now, Barbara, you
know me, and you know my Aunt Evelina. She&rsquo;s a
good enough woman; I&rsquo;m the first to say so. But
who is she to take care of a young girl? She&rsquo;s ignorant
of the world to that degree she believes in Beau Austin!
Now you and I, Bab, who are not so high and dry, see
through and through him; we know that a man like
that is no fit company for any inexperienced girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>127</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> O Mr. Anthony, don&rsquo;t say that. (<i>Weeping.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Hullo! what&rsquo;s wrong?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> Nothing that I know of. O Mr. Anthony, I
don&rsquo;t think there can be anything.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Think? Don&rsquo;t think? What&rsquo;s this?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> O sir! I don&rsquo;t know, and yet I don&rsquo;t like it.
Here&rsquo;s my beautiful necklace all broke to bits: she took
it off my very neck, and gave me her birthday pearls
instead; and I found it afterwards on the table, all
smashed to pieces; and all she wanted it for was to
take and break it. Why that? It frightens me, Mr.
Anthony, it frightens me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony</span> (<i>with necklace</i>). This? What has this trumpery
to do with us?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> He gave it me: that&rsquo;s why she broke it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> He? Who?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> Mr. Austin did; and I do believe I should
not have taken it, Mr. Anthony, but I thought no
harm, upon my word of honour. He was always
here; that was six months ago; and indeed, indeed,
I thought they were to marry. How would I think else
with a born lady like Miss Dorothy?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Why, Barbara, God help us all, what&rsquo;s this?
You don&rsquo;t mean to say that there was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> Here it is, as true as true: they were going
for a jaunt; and Miss Foster had her gout; and I was
to go with them; and he told me to make-believe I was
ill; and I did; and I stayed at home; and he gave me
that necklace; and they went away together; and, O
dear! I wish I&rsquo;d never been born.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Together? he and Dolly? Good Lord! my
sister! And since then?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> We haven&rsquo;t seen him from that day to this,
the wicked villain; and, Mr. Anthony, he hasn&rsquo;t so
much as written the poor dear a word.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Bab, Bab, Bab, this is a devil of a bad business;
this is a cruel, bad business, Baby; cruel upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>128</span>
me, cruel upon all of us; a family like mine. I&rsquo;m a
young man, Barbara, to have this delicate affair to
manage; but, thank God, I&rsquo;m Musgrave to the bone.
He bribed a servant-maid, did he? I keep his bribe;
it&rsquo;s mine now: dear bought, by George! He shall
have it in his teeth. Shot Colonel Villiers, did he?
we&rsquo;ll see how he faces Anthony Musgrave. You&rsquo;re a
good girl, Barbara; so far you&rsquo;ve served the family.
You leave this to me. And, hark ye, dry your eyes
and hold your tongue: I&rsquo;ll have no scandal raised by
you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> I do hope, sir, you won&rsquo;t use me against Miss
Dorothy.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> That&rsquo;s my affair; your business is to hold your
tongue. Miss Dorothy has made her bed and must
lie on it. Here&rsquo;s Jack Fenwick. You can go.</p>




<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE V</h4>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Anthony, Fenwick</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Jack Fenwick, is that you? Come here, my
boy. Jack, you&rsquo;ve given me many a thrashing, and
I deserved &rsquo;em; and I&rsquo;ll not see you made a fool of now.
George Austin is a damned villain, and Dorothy Musgrave
is no girl for you to marry: God help me that I
should have to say it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Good God, who told <i>you</i>?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Ay, Jack; it&rsquo;s hard on me, Jack. But you&rsquo;ll
stand my friend in spite of this, and you&rsquo;ll take my
message to the man, won&rsquo;t you? For it&rsquo;s got to come
to blood, Jack: there&rsquo;s no way out of that. And perhaps
your poor friend will fall, Jack; think of that:
like Villiers. And all for an unworthy sister.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Now, Anthony Musgrave, I give you fair warning;
see you take it: one more word against your
sister, and we quarrel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"></a>129</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> You let it slip yourself, Jack: you know yourself
she&rsquo;s not a virtuous girl.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> What do you know of virtue, whose whole
boast is to be vicious? How dare you draw conclusions?
Dolt and puppy! you can no more comprehend
that angel&rsquo;s excellences than she can stoop to believe
in your vices. And you talk morality? Anthony,
I&rsquo;m a man who has been somewhat roughly tried: take
care.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> You don&rsquo;t seem able to grasp the situation,
Jack. It&rsquo;s very remarkable; I&rsquo;m the girl&rsquo;s natural
protector; and you should buckle-to and help, like a
friend of the family. And instead of that, begad!
you turn on me like all the rest.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Now mark me fairly: Mr. Austin follows
at my heels; he comes to offer marriage to your sister&mdash;that
is all you know, and all you shall know; and
if by any misplaced insolence of yours this marriage
should miscarry, you have to answer, not to Mr. Austin
only, but to me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> It&rsquo;s all a most discreditable business, and I
don&rsquo;t see how you propose to better it by cutting
my throat. Of course, if he&rsquo;s going to marry her, it&rsquo;s
a different thing, but I don&rsquo;t believe he is, or he&rsquo;d
have asked me. You think me a fool? Well, see they
marry, or they&rsquo;ll find me a dangerous fool.</p>






<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>

<p class="ct"><i>To these, <span class="sc">Austin</span>, <span class="sc">Barbara</span> announcing</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> Mr. Austin. (<i>She shows <span class="sc">Austin</span> in, and retires.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> You will do me the justice to acknowledge, Mr.
Fenwick, that I have been not long delayed by my
devotion to the Graces.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> So, sir, I find you in my house&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"></a>130</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> And charmed to meet you again. It went against
my conscience to separate so soon. Youth, Mr. Musgrave,
is to us older men a perpetual refreshment.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> You came here, sir, I suppose, upon some
errand?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> My errand, Mr. Musgrave, is to your fair sister.
Beauty, as you know, comes before valour.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> In my own house, and about my own sister,
I presume I have the right to ask for something more
explicit.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> The right, my dear sir, is beyond question; but
it is one, as you were going on to observe, on which no
gentleman insists.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Anthony, my good fellow, I think we had better
go.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> I have asked a question.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Which I was charmed to answer, but which, on
repetition, might begin to grow distasteful.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> In my own house&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> For God&rsquo;s sake, Anthony!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> In your aunt&rsquo;s house, young gentleman, I shall
be careful to refrain from criticism. I am come upon
a visit to a lady: that visit I shall pay; when you
desire (if it be possible that you desire it) to resume
this singular conversation, select some fitter place.
Mr. Fenwick, this afternoon, may I present you to his
Royal Highness?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Why, sir, I believe you must have misconceived
me. I have no wish to offend: at least at present.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Enough, sir. I was persuaded I had heard amiss.
I trust we shall be friends.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Come, Anthony, come: here is your sister.

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Austin, Dorothy</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> I am told, Mr. Austin, that you wish to see
me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Madam, can you doubt of that desire? can you
question my sincerity?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Sir, between you and me these compliments
are worse than idle: they are unkind. Sure, we are
alone!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> I find you in an hour of cruelty, I fear. Yet
you have condescended to receive this poor offender;
and, having done so much, you will not refuse to give
him audience.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> You shall have no cause, sir, to complain of
me. I listen.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> My fair friend, I have sent myself&mdash;a poor ambassador&mdash;to
plead for your forgiveness. I have been
too long absent; too long, I would fain hope, madam,
for you; too long for my honour and my love. I am
no longer, madam, in my first youth; but I may
say that I am not unknown. My fortune, originally
small, has not suffered from my husbandry. I have
excellent health, an excellent temper, and the purest
ardour of affection for your person. I found not on my
merits, but on your indulgence. Miss Musgrave, will
you honour me with your hand in marriage?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Mr. Austin, if I thought basely of marriage, I
should perhaps accept your offer. There was a time,
indeed, when it would have made me proudest among
women. I was the more deceived, and have to thank
you for a salutary lesson. You chose to count me as a
cipher in your rolls of conquest; for six months you
left me to my fate; and you come here to-day&mdash;prompted,
I doubt not, by an honourable impulse&mdash;to
offer this tardy reparation. No; it is too late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>132</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Do you refuse?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Yours is the blame; we are no longer equal.
You have robbed me of the right to marry any one but
you; and do you think me, then, so poor in spirit as to
accept a husband on compulsion?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Dorothy, you loved me once.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Ay, you will never guess how much: you
will never live to understand how ignominious a defeat
that conquest was. I loved and trusted you: I judged
you by myself; think, then, of my humiliation, when,
at the touch of trial, all your qualities proved false,
and I beheld you the slave of the meanest vanity&mdash;selfish,
untrue, base! Think, sir, what a humbling of
my pride to have been thus deceived; to have taken for
my idol such a commonplace imposture as yourself;
to have loved&mdash;yes, loved&mdash;such a shadow, such a
mockery of man. And now I am unworthy to be the
wife of any gentleman; and you&mdash;look me in the face,
George&mdash;are you worthy to be my husband?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> No, Dorothy, I am not. I was a vain fool;
I blundered away the most precious opportunity; and
my regret will be lifelong. Do me the justice to accept
this full confession of my fault. I am here to-day to
own and to repair it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Repair it? Sir, you condescend too far.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> I perceive with shame how grievously I had
misjudged you. But now, Dorothy, believe me, my
eyes are opened. I plead with you, not as my equal,
but as one in all ways better than myself. I admire
you, not in that trivial sense in which we men are wont
to speak of women, but as God&rsquo;s work: as a wise mind,
a noble soul, and a most generous heart, from whose
society I have all to gain, all to learn. Dorothy, in one
word, I love you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> And what, sir, has wrought this transformation?
You knew me of old, or thought you knew me? Is it
in six months of selfish absence that your mind has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>133</span>
changed? When did that change begin? A week
ago? Sure, you would have written! To-day?
Sir, if this offer be anything more than fresh offence,
I have a right to be enlightened.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Madam, I foresaw this question. So be it: I
respect, and I will not deceive you. But give me,
first of all, a moment for defence. There are few
men of my habits and position who would have done
as I have done: sate at the feet of a young boy, accepted
his lessons, gone upon his errand: fewer still, who
would thus, at the crisis of a love, risk the whole fortune
of the soul&mdash;love, gratitude, even respect. Yet more
than that! For conceive how I respect you, if I, whose
lifelong trade has been flattery, stand before you and
make the plain confession of a truth that must not
only lower me, but deeply wound yourself.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> What means&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Young Fenwick, my rival for your heart, he it
was that sent me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> He? O disgrace! He sent you! That was
what he meant? Am I fallen so low? Am I your common
talk among men? Did you dice for me? Did he
kneel? O John, John, how could you! And you, Mr.
Austin, whither have you brought me down? shame
heaping upon shame&mdash;to what end! O, to what end?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Madam, you wound me: you look wilfully amiss.
Sure, any lady in the land might well be proud to be
loved as you are loved, with such nobility as Mr. Fenwick&rsquo;s,
with such humility as mine. I came, indeed,
in pity, in good-nature, what you will. (See, dearest
lady, with what honesty I speak: if I win you, it shall
be with the unblemished truth.) All that is gone.
Pity? it is myself I pity. I offer you not love&mdash;I am
not worthy. I ask, I beseech of you: suffer me to
wait upon you like a servant, to serve you with my
rank, my name, the whole devotion of my life. I am
a gentleman&mdash;ay, in spite of my fault&mdash;an upright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>134</span>
gentleman; and I swear to you that you shall order
your life and mine at your free will. Dorothy, at your
feet, in remorse, in respect, in love&mdash;O such love as I
have never felt, such love as I derided&mdash;I implore, I
conjure you to be mine!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Too late! too late.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> No, no; not too late: not too late for penitence,
not too late for love.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Which do you propose? that I should abuse
your compassion, or reward your treachery? George
Austin, I have been your mistress, and I will never
be your wife.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Child, dear child, I have not told you all: there
is worse still: your brother knows; the boy as good as
told me. Dorothy, this is scandal at the door&mdash;O let
that move you: for that, if not for my sake, for that,
if not for love, trust me, trust me again.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> I am so much the more your victim: that is
all, and shall that change my heart? The sin must
have its wages. This, too, was done long ago: when
you stooped to lie to me. The shame is still mine, the
fault still yours.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Child, child, you kill me: you will not understand.
Can you not see? the lad will force me to a
duel.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> And you will kill him? Shame after shame,
threat upon threat. Marry me, or you are dishonoured;
marry me, or your brother dies: and this is man&rsquo;s
honour! But my honour and my pride are different.
I will encounter all misfortune sooner than degrade
myself by an unfaithful marriage. How should I kneel
before the altar, and vow to reverence as my husband
you, you who deceived me as my lover?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Dorothy, you misjudge me cruelly; I have
deserved it. You will not take me for your husband;
why should I wonder? You are right. I have indeed
filled your life with calamity: the wages, ay, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>135</span>
wages, of my sin are heavy upon you. But I have one
more thing to ask of your pity; and O remember, child,
who it is that asks it: a man guilty in your sight, void
of excuse, but old, and very proud, and most unused
to supplication. Dorothy Musgrave, will you forgive
George Austin?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> O George!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> It is the old name: that is all I ask, and more
than I deserve. I shall remember, often remember,
how and where it was bestowed upon me for the last
time. I thank you, Dorothy, from my heart; a heart,
child, that has been too long silent, but is not too old,
I thank God! not yet too old to learn a lesson and to
accept a reproof. I will not keep you longer: I will go&mdash;I
am so bankrupt in credit that I dare not ask you to
believe in how much sorrow. But, Dorothy, my acts
will speak for me with more persuasion. If it be in my
power, you shall suffer no more through me: I will
avoid your brother; I will leave this place, I will leave
England, to-morrow; you shall be no longer tortured
with the neighbourhood of your ungenerous lover.
Dorothy, farewell!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy</span> (<i>on her knees and reaching with her hands</i>).
George, George! (<i>Enter <span class="sc">Anthony</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Ha! what are you crying for?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Nothing, dear. (<i>Rising.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Is Austin going to marry you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> I shall never marry.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> I thought as much. You should have come
to me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> I know, dear, I know; but there was nothing
to come about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagev"></a>136</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> It&rsquo;s a lie. You have disgraced the family.
You went to John Fenwick: see what he has made of
it. But I will have you righted: it shall be atoned in
the man&rsquo;s blood.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Anthony! And if I had refused him?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> You? refuse George Austin? You never
had the chance.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> I have refused him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Dorothy, you lie. You would shield your
lover; but this concerns not you only: it strikes my
honour and my father&rsquo;s honour.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> I have refused him&mdash;refused him, I tell you&mdash;refused
him. The blame is mine; are you so mad and
wicked that you will not see?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> I see this: that man must die.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> He? never! You forget, you forget whom
you defy; you run upon your death.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Ah, my girl, you should have thought of that
before. It is too late now.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Anthony, if I beg you&mdash;Anthony, I have tried
to be a good sister; I brought you up, dear, nursed you
when you were sick, fought for you, hoped for you,
loved you&mdash;think of it, think of the dear past, think of
our home and the happy winter nights, the castles in
the fire, the long shining future, the love that was to
forgive and suffer always&mdash;O you will spare, you will
spare me this.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> I will tell you what I will do, Dolly: I will
do just what you taught me&mdash;my duty: that, and
nothing else.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> O Anthony, you also, you to strike me!
Heavens, shall I kill them&mdash;I&mdash;I, that love them,
kill them! Miserable, sinful girl! George, George,
thank God, you will be far away! O go, George, go
at once!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> He goes, the coward! Ay, is this more of
your contrivance? Madam, you make me blush.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>137</span>
But to-day at least I know where I can find him.
This afternoon, on the Pantiles, he must dance attendance
on the Duke of York. Already he must be there;
and there he is at my mercy.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Thank God, you are deceived: he will not
fight. He promised me that; thank God, I have his
promise for that.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Promise! Do you see this? (<i>producing
necklace</i>) the thing he bribed your maid with? I shall
dash it in his teeth before the Duke and before all
Tunbridge. Promise, you poor fool? what promise
holds against a blow? Get to your knees and pray
for him; for, by the God above, if he has any blood in
his body, one of us shall die before to-night. (<i>He goes

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy.</span> Anthony, Anthony!... O my God,

<p class="ct"><i><span class="sc">Miss Foster, Barbara, Menteith</span>; Visitors</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster</span> (<i>entering; escorted by <span class="sc">Menteith</span>, and followed
by <span class="sc">Barbara</span></i>). And so, Menteith, here you are once
more. And vastly pleased I am to see you, my good
fellow, not only for your own sake, but because you
harbinger the Beau. (<i>Sits, L., <span class="sc">Menteith</span> standing over
her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> Honoured madam, I have had the pleasure
to serve Mr. George for more than thirty years. This
is a privilege&mdash;a very great privilege. I have beheld
him in the first societies, moving among the first rank
of personages; and none, madam, none outshone him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> I assure you, madam, when Mr. Menteith took
me to the play, he talked so much of Mr. Austin that
I couldn&rsquo;t hear a word of Mr. Kean.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Well, well, and very right. That was
the old school of service, Barbara, which you would
do well to imitate.&mdash;This is a child, Menteith, that I
am trying to form.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> Quite so, madam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>139</span>
<span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> And are we soon to see our princely guest,
Menteith?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> His Royal Highness, madam? I believe I
may say quite so. Mr. George will receive our gallant
prince upon the Pantiles (<i>looking at his watch</i>) in, I
should say, a matter of twelve minutes from now.
Such, madam, is Mr. George&rsquo;s order of the day.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> I beg your pardon, madam, I am sure, but
are we really to see one of His Majesty&rsquo;s own brothers?
That will be pure! O madam, this is better than
Carlisle.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> The wood-note wild: a loyal Cumbrian,
Menteith.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> Eh? Quite so, madam.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> When she has seen as much of the Royal
Family as you, my good fellow, she will find it vastly
less entertaining.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> Yes, madam, indeed; in these distinguished
circles life is but a slavery. None of the best set would
relish Tunbridge without Mr. George; Tunbridge and
Mr. George (if you&rsquo;ll excuse my plainness, madam)
are in a manner of speaking identified; and indeed
it was the Dook&rsquo;s desire alone that brought us
here.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Barbara.</span> What? the Duke? O dear! was it for that?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> Though, to be sure, madam, Mr. George would
always be charmed to find himself (<i>bowing</i>) among so
many admired members of his own set.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Upon my word, Menteith, Mr. Austin is
as fortunate in his servant as his reputation.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> Quite so, madam. But let me observe that
the opportunities I have had of acquiring a knowledge
of Mr. George&rsquo;s character have been positively unrivalled.
Nobody knows Mr. George like his old attendant. The
goodness of that gentleman&mdash;but, madam, you will
soon be equally fortunate, if, as I understand, it is to be
a match.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>140</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> I hope, Menteith, you are not taking leave
of your senses. Is it possible you mean my niece?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Menteith.</span> Madam, I have the honour to congratulate
you. I put a second curl in Mr. George&rsquo;s hair on purpose.</p>






<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE II</h4>

<p><i>To these, <span class="sc">Austin</span>. <span class="sc">Menteith</span> falls back, and <span class="sc">Austin</span>
takes his place in front of <span class="sc">Miss Foster</span>, his attitude
a counterpart of <span class="sc">Menteith&rsquo;s</span></i></p>
<div style="padding-top: 0.5em; ">&nbsp;</div>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Madam, I hasten to present my homage.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> A truce to compliments; Menteith, your
charming fellow there, has set me positively crazy.
Dear George Austin, is it true? Can it be true?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Madam, if he has been praising your niece he
has been well inspired. If he was speaking, as I spoke
an hour ago myself, I wish, Miss Foster, that he had
held his tongue. I have indeed offered myself to Miss
Dorothy, and she, with the most excellent reason, has
refused me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Is it possible? why, my dear George
Austin, ... then I suppose it is John Fenwick
after all?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Not one of us is worthy.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> This is the most amazing circumstance.
You take my breath away. My niece refuse George
Austin? why, I give you my word, I thought she
had adored you. A perfect scandal: it positively must
not get abroad.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Madam, for that young lady I have a singular
regard. Judge me as tenderly as you can, and set it
down, if you must, to an old man&rsquo;s vanity&mdash;for, Evelina,
we are no longer in the heyday of our youth&mdash;judge
me as you will: I should prefer to have it known.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> Can you? George Austin, you? My
youth was nothing; I was a failure; but for you?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>141</span>
no, George, you never can, you never must be old.
You are the triumph of my generation, George, and
of our old friendship too. Think of my first dance and
my first partner. And to have this story&mdash;no, I
could not bear to have it told of you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Madam, there are some ladies over whom it is
a boast to have prevailed; there are others whom it
is a glory to have loved. And I am so vain, dear
Evelina, that even thus I am proud to link my name
with that of Dorothy Musgrave.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Miss Foster.</span> George, you are changed. I would not
know you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> I scarce know myself. But pardon me, dear
friend (<i>taking out his watch</i>), in less than four minutes
our illustrious guest will descend amongst us; and I
observe Mr. Fenwick, with whom I have a pressing
business. Suffer me, dear Evelina!&mdash;&mdash;</p>






<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE III</h4>

<p><i>To these, <span class="sc">Fenwick</span>. <span class="sc">Miss Foster</span> remains seated, L.
<span class="sc">Austin</span> goes R. to <span class="sc">Fenwick</span>, whom he salutes with
great respect</i></p>
<div style="padding-top: 0.5em; ">&nbsp;</div>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Mr. Fenwick, I have played and lost. That
noble lady, justly incensed at my misconduct, has
condemned me. Under the burden of such a loss,
may I console myself with the esteem of Mr. Fenwick?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> She refused you? Pardon me, sir, but was
the fault not yours?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Perhaps to my shame, I am no novice, Mr.
Fenwick; but I have never felt nor striven as to-day.
I went upon your errand; but, you may trust me, sir,
before I had done I found it was my own. Until to-day
I never rightly valued her; sure, she is fit to be a queen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"></a>142</span>
I have a remorse here at my heart to which I am a
stranger. O! that was a brave life, that was a great
heart that I have ruined.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Ay, sir, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> But, sir, it is not to lament the irretrievable
that I intrude myself upon your leisure. There is
something to be done, to save, at least to spare, that
lady. You did not fail to observe the brother?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> No, sir, he knows all; and being both intemperate
and ignorant&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Surely. I know. I have to ask you then to
find what friends you can among this company;
and if you have none, to make them. Let everybody
hear the news. Tell it (if I may offer the suggestion)
with humour: how Mr. Austin, somewhat upon the
wane, but still filled with sufficiency, gloriously presumed
and was most ingloriously set down by a young
lady from the north: the lady&rsquo;s name a secret, which
you will permit to be divined. The laugh&mdash;the position
of the hero&mdash;will make it circulate;&mdash;you perceive I am
in earnest;&mdash;and in this way I believe our young friend
will find himself forestalled.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fenwick.</span> Mr. Austin, I would not have dared to ask
so much of you; I will go further: were the positions
changed, I should fear to follow your example.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Child, child, you could not afford it.</p>

<div style="padding-top: 0.5em; ">&nbsp;</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>143</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Dear child, let me present you to his Royal
Highness.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony</span> (<i>with necklace</i>). Mr. Austin, do you recognise
the bribe you gave my sister&rsquo;s maid?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> Hush, sir, hush! you forget the presence of the
Duke.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> Mr. Austin, you are a coward and a scoundrel.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin.</span> My child, you will regret these words: I refuse
your quarrel.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anthony.</span> You do? Take that. (<i>He strikes <span class="sc">Austin</span>

shrieks. Sensation. Music stops. Tableau</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin</span> (<i>recovering his composure</i>). Your Royal Highness,
suffer me to excuse the disrespect of this young
gentleman. He has so much apology, and I have, I
hope, so good a credit, as incline me to accept this
blow. But I must beg of your Highness, and, gentlemen,
all of you here present, to bear with me while
I will explain what is too capable of misconstruction.
I am the rejected suitor of this young gentleman&rsquo;s
sister; of Miss Dorothy Musgrave: a lady whom I
singularly honour and esteem; a word from whom
(if I could hope that word) would fill my life with
happiness. I was not worthy of that lady; when I
was defeated in fair field, I presumed to make advances
through her maid. See in how laughable a manner
fate repaid me! The waiting-girl derided, the mistress
denied, and now comes in this very ardent champion
who publicly insults me. My vanity is cured; you
will judge it right, I am persuaded, all of you, that
I should accept my proper punishment in silence;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"></a>144</span>
you, my Lord Duke, to pardon this young gentleman;
and you, Mr. Musgrave, to spare me further provocation,
which I am determined to ignore.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorothy</span> (<i>rushing forward, falling at <span class="sc">Austin&rsquo;s</span> knees,
and seizing his hand</i>). George, George, it was for me.
My hero! take me! What you will!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Austin</span> (<i>in an agony</i>). My dear creature, remember
that we are in public. (<i>Raising her.</i>) Your Royal
Highness, may I present you Mrs. George Frederick
Austin? (<i>The curtain falls on a few bars of &ldquo;The
Lass of Richmond Hill.&rdquo;</i>)</p>

<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<p class="ct"><i><span class="sc">Arethusa</span> is discovered, dusting</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Ten months and a week to-day! Now for
a new mark. Since the last, the sun has set and risen
over the fields and the pleasant trees at home, and on
Kit&rsquo;s lone ship and the empty sea. Perhaps it blew,
perhaps rained; (<i>at the chart</i>) perhaps he was far up
here to the nor&rsquo;ard, where the icebergs sail; perhaps
at anchor among these wild islands of the snakes and
buccaneers. O, you big chart, if I could see him sailing
on you! North and South Atlantic; such a weary
sight of water and no land; never an island for the
poor lad to land upon. But still God&rsquo;s there. (<i>She
takes down the telescope to dust it.</i>) Father&rsquo;s spy-glass
again; and my poor Kit perhaps with such another,
sweeping the great deep!</p>

<h4>SCENE II</h4>

<p class="ct"><i><span class="sc">Arethusa</span>; to her, <span class="sc">Kit</span>, C. He enters on tiptoe,
and she does not see or hear him.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa</span> (<i>dusting telescope</i>). At sea they have less dust
at least: that&rsquo;s so much comfort.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Sweetheart, ahoy!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Kit!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Arethusa!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> My Kit! Home again&mdash;O my love!&mdash;home
again to me!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> As straight as wind and tide could carry me!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> O Kit, my dearest. O Kit&mdash;O! O!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Hey? Steady, lass: steady, I say. For goodness&rsquo;
sake, ease it off.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> I will, Kit&mdash;I will. But you came so sudden.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> I thought ten months of it about preparation
enough.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Ten months and a week; you haven&rsquo;t counted
the days as I have. Another day gone, and one day
nearer to Kit: that has been my almanac. How
brown you are! how handsome!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> A pity you can&rsquo;t see yourself! Well, no, I&rsquo;ll never
be handsome: brown I may be, never handsome.
But I&rsquo;m better than that, if the proverb&rsquo;s true; for I&rsquo;m
ten hundred thousand fathoms deep in love. I bring
you a faithful sailor. What! you don&rsquo;t think much
of that for a curiosity? Well, that&rsquo;s so: you&rsquo;re
right; the rarity is in the girl that&rsquo;s worth it ten times
over. Faithful? I couldn&rsquo;t help it if I tried! No,
sweetheart, and I fear nothing: I don&rsquo;t know what
fear is, but just of losing you. (<i>Starting.</i>) Lord,
that&rsquo;s not the Admiral?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Aha, Mr. Dreadnought! you see you fear
my father.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> That I do. But, thank goodness, it&rsquo;s nobody. Kiss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>153</span>
me: no, I won&rsquo;t kiss you: kiss <i>me</i>. I&rsquo;ll give you a
present for that. See!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> A wedding-ring!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> My mother&rsquo;s. Will you take it?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Yes, will I&mdash;and give myself for it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Ah, if we could only count upon your father! He&rsquo;s
a man every inch of him; but he can&rsquo;t endure Kit
French.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> He hasn&rsquo;t learned to know you, Kit, as I
have, nor yet do you know him. He seems hard and
violent; at heart he is only a man overwhelmed with
sorrow. Why else, when he looks at me and does not
know that I observe him, should his face change, and
fill with such tenderness, that I could weep to see him?
Why, when he walks in his sleep, as he does almost
every night, his eyes open and beholding nothing, why
should he cry so pitifully on my mother&rsquo;s name? Ah,
if you could hear him then, you would say yourself:
Here is a man that has loved; here is a man that will
be kind to lovers.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Is that so? Ay, it&rsquo;s a hard thing to lose your
wife; ay, that must cut the heart indeed. But for
all that, my lass, your father is keen for the doubloons.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Right, Kit: and small blame to him. There
is only one way to be honest, and the name of that is
thrift.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Well, and that&rsquo;s my motto. I&rsquo;ve left the ship; no
more letters of marque for me. Good-bye to Kit
French, privateersman&rsquo;s mate; and how-d&rsquo;ye-do to
Christopher, the coasting skipper. I&rsquo;ve seen the
very boat for me: I&rsquo;ve enough to buy her, too; and
to furnish a good house, and keep a shot in the locker
for bad luck. So far, there&rsquo;s nothing to gainsay.
So far it&rsquo;s hopeful enough; but still there&rsquo;s Admiral
Guinea, you know&mdash;and the plain truth is that I&rsquo;m
afraid of him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Admiral Guinea? Now, Kit, if you are to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"></a>154</span>
be true lover of mine, you shall not use that name.
His name is Captain Gaunt. As for fearing him, Kit
French, you&rsquo;re not the man for me, if you fear anything
but sin. He&rsquo;s a stern man because he&rsquo;s in the right.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> He is a man of God; I am what he calls a child of
perdition. I was a privateersman&mdash;serving my country,
I say; but he calls it pirate. He is thrifty and sober;
he has a treasure, they say, and it lies so near his heart
that he tumbles up in his sleep to stand watch over it.
What has a harum-scarum dog like me to expect from
a man like him? He won&rsquo;t see I&rsquo;m starving for a chance
to mend. &ldquo;Mend,&rdquo; he&rsquo;ll say; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be shot if you
mend at the expense of my daughter&rdquo;; and the worst
of it is, you see, he&rsquo;ll be right.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Kit, if you dare to say that faint-hearted word
again, I&rsquo;ll take my ring off. What are we for but to
grow better or grow worse? Do you think Arethusa
French will be the same as Arethusa Gaunt?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> I don&rsquo;t want her better.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Ah, but she shall be!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Hark, here he is! By George, it&rsquo;s neck or nothing
now. Stand by to back me up.</p>





<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE III</h4>

<p class="ct"><i>To these, <span class="sc">Gaunt</span>, C.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit</span> (<i>with <span class="sc">Arethusa&rsquo;s</span> hand</i>). Captain Gaunt, I have
come to ask you for your daughter.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Hum. (<i>He sits in his chair, L.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> I love her, and she loves me, sir. I&rsquo;ve left the
privateering. I&rsquo;ve enough to set me up and buy a
tidy sloop&mdash;Jack Lee&rsquo;s; you know the boat, Captain;
clinker built, not four years old, eighty tons burthen,
steers like a child. I&rsquo;ve put my mother&rsquo;s ring on Arethusa&rsquo;s
finger; and if you&rsquo;ll give us your blessing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"></a>155</span>
I&rsquo;ll engage to turn over a new leaf, and make her a
good husband.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> In whose strength, Christopher French?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> In the strength of my good, honest love for her:
as you did for her mother, and my father for mine.
And you know, Captain, a man can&rsquo;t command the
wind; but (excuse me, sir) he can always lie the best
course possible, and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do, so God help me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Arethusa, you at least are the child of many
prayers; your eyes have been unsealed; and to you
the world stands naked, a morning watch for duration,
a thing spun of cobwebs for solidity. In the presence
of an angry God, I ask you: Have you heard this
man?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Father, I know Kit, and I love him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> I say it solemnly, this is no Christian union.
To you, Christopher French, I will speak nothing of
eternal truths: I will speak to you the language of
this world. You have been trained among sinners
who gloried in their sin: in your whole life you never
saved one farthing; and now, when your pockets are
full, you think you can begin, poor dupe, in your own
strength. You are a roysterer, a jovial companion;
you mean no harm&mdash;you are nobody&rsquo;s enemy but your
own. No doubt you tell this girl of mine, and no doubt
you tell yourself, that you can change. Christopher,
speaking under correction, I defy you! You ask me for
this child of many supplications, for this brand plucked
from the burning: I look at you: I read you through
and through; and I tell you&mdash;no! (<i>Striking table
with his fist.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Captain Gaunt, if you mean that I am not worthy
of her, I&rsquo;m the first to say so. But, if you&rsquo;ll excuse
me, sir, I&rsquo;m a young man, and young men are no better&rsquo;n
they ought to be; it&rsquo;s known; they&rsquo;re all like that;
and what&rsquo;s their chance? To be married to a girl like
this! And would you refuse it to me? Why, sir, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>156</span>
yourself, when you came courting, you were young and
rough; and yet I&rsquo;ll make bold to say that Mrs. Gaunt
was a happy woman, and the saving of yourself into the
bargain. Well, now, Captain Gaunt, will you deny
another man, and that man a sailor, the very salvation
that you had yourself?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Salvation, Christopher French, is from above.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Well, sir, that is so; but there&rsquo;s means, too; and
what means so strong as the wife a man has to strive
and toil for, and that bears the punishment whenever
he goes wrong? Now, sir, I&rsquo;ve spoke with your old
shipmates in the Guinea trade. Hard as nails, they
said, and true as the compass: as rough as a slaver,
but as just as a judge. Well, sir, you hear me plead:
I ask you for my chance; don&rsquo;t you deny it to me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> You speak of me? In the true balances we both
weigh nothing. But two things I know: the depth
of iniquity, how foul it is; and the agony with which
a man repents. Not until seven devils were cast out
of me did I awake; each rent me as it passed. Ay,
that was repentance. Christopher, Christopher, you
have sailed before the wind since first you weighed
your anchor, and now you think to sail upon a bow-line?
You do not know your ship, young man: you
will go to le&rsquo;ward like a sheet of paper; I tell you so
that know&mdash;I tell you so that have tried, and failed,
and wrestled in the sweat of prayer, and at last, at last,
have tasted grace. But, meanwhile, no flesh and blood
of mine shall lie at the mercy of such a wretch as I was
then, or as you are this day. I could not own the deed
before the face of heaven, if I sanctioned this unequal
yoke. Arethusa, pluck off that ring from off your
finger. Christopher French, take it, and go hence.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Arethusa, what do you say?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> O Kit, you know my heart. But he is alone,
and I am his only comfort; and I owe all to him;
and shall I not obey my father? But, Kit, if you will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"></a>157</span>
let me, I will keep your ring. Go, Kit; go, and prove
to my father that he was mistaken; go and win me.
And O, Kit, if ever you should weary, come to me&mdash;no,
do not come! but send a word&mdash;and I shall know all,
and you shall have your ring. (<i><span class="sc">Gaunt</span> opens his Bible
and begins to read.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Don&rsquo;t say that, don&rsquo;t say such things to me; I sink
or swim with you. (<i>To <span class="sc">Gaunt</span>.</i>) Old man, you&rsquo;ve
struck me hard; give me a good word to go with.
Name your time; I&rsquo;ll stand the test. Give me a spark
of hope, and I&rsquo;ll fight through for it. Say just this&mdash;&ldquo;Prove
I was mistaken,&rdquo; and by George, I&rsquo;ll prove it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt</span> (<i>looking up</i>). I make no such compacts. Go,
and swear not at all.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Go, Kit! I keep the ring.</p>

<h4>SCENE IV</h4>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Arethusa, Gaunt</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Father, what have we done that you should
be so cruel?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt</span> (<i>laying down Bible, and rising</i>). Do you call
me cruel? You speak after the flesh. I have done
you this day a service that you will live to bless me
for upon your knees.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> He loves me, and I love him: you can never
alter that; do what you will, father, that can never
change. I love him, I believe in him, I will be true to
him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Arethusa, you are the sole thing death has left
me on this earth; and I must watch over your carnal
happiness and your eternal weal. You do not know
what this implies to me. Your mother&mdash;my Hester&mdash;tongue
cannot tell, nor heart conceive the pangs
she suffered. If it lies in me, your life shall not be
lost on that same reef of an ungodly husband. (<i>Goes
out, C.</i>)</p>

<h4>SCENE V</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> I thought the time dragged long and weary
when I knew that Kit was homeward bound, all the
white sails a-blowing out towards England, and my
Kit&rsquo;s face turned this way! (<i>She begins to dust.</i>)
Sure, if my mother were here she would understand
and help us; she would understand a young maid&rsquo;s
heart, though her own had never an ache; and she
would love my Kit. (<i>Putting back the telescope.</i>)
To think she died: husband and child&mdash;and so much
love&mdash;she was taken from them all. Ah, there is no
parting but the grave! And Kit and I both live,
and both love each other; and here am I cast down?
O, Arethusa, shame! And your love home from the
deep seas, and loving you still; and the sun shining;
and the world all full of hope? O, Hope, you&rsquo;re a
good word!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> What can I do for you, sailor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>159</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Good Christian lady, help a poor blind mariner to
a mouthful of meat. I&rsquo;ve served His Majesty in every
quarter of the globe; I&rsquo;ve spoke with &rsquo;Awke and
glorious Anson, as I might with you: and I&rsquo;ve tramped
it all night long upon my sinful feet, and with a empty
belly.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> You shall not ask bread and be denied by a

when my father returns he shall give you something
to set you on your road.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Kind and lovely lady, do you tell me that you
are in a manner of speaking alone? or do my ears
deceive a poor blind seaman?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> I live here with my father, and my father

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Dear, beautiful, Christian lady, tell a poor blind

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Sweet lady, answer a poor blind man one other

to Cap&rsquo;n John Gaunt? Cap&rsquo;n John as in the ebony
trade were known as Admiral Guinea?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Captain John Gaunt is my father.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew</span> (<i>dropping the blind man&rsquo;s whine</i>). Lord, think of
that now! They told me this was where he lived, and

the Admiral&rsquo;s own bo&rsquo;sun, colloguing in his old commander&rsquo;s
parlour, with his old commander&rsquo;s gal (<i>seizes

about three bells in the middle watch, old Pew will
take a little cruise, and lay aboard his ancient friend
the Admiral; or, barring that, the Admiral&rsquo;s old sea-chest&mdash;the
chest he kept the shiners in aboard the
brig. Where is it, I wonder? in his berth, or in the
cabin here? It&rsquo;s big enough, and the brass bands is
plain to feel by. (<i>Searching about with stick.</i>) Dresser&mdash;chair

what&rsquo;s this?&mdash;a book&mdash;sheepskin&mdash;smells
like a &rsquo;oly Bible. Chair (<i>his stick just avoids
the chest</i>). No sea-chest. I must have a mate to see
for me, to see for old Pew: him as had eyes like a
eagle! Meanwhile, rum. Corner cupboard, of course

Footsteps. Is it the Admiral? (<i>With the whine.</i>)

<h4>SCENE VIII</h4>

<p class="ct"><i><span class="sc">Pew</span>; to him, <span class="sc">Gaunt</span></i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> What brings you here?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Cap&rsquo;n, do my ears deceive me? or is this my old
commander?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> My name is John Gaunt. Who are you, my man,
and what&rsquo;s your business?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Here&rsquo;s the facks, so help me. A lovely female
in this house was Christian enough to pity the poor
blind; and lo and be&rsquo;old! who should she turn out to
be but my old commander&rsquo;s daughter! &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo;
says I to her, &ldquo;I was the Admiral&rsquo;s own particular
bo&rsquo;sun.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;La, sailor,&rdquo; she says to me, &ldquo;how glad
he&rsquo;ll be to see you!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t he just&mdash;that&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>163</span>
all.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and fetch him,&rdquo; she says; &ldquo;you
make yourself at &rsquo;ome.&rdquo; And off she went; and,
Commander, here I am.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt</span> (<i>sitting down</i>). Well.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Well, Cap&rsquo;n?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> What do you want?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Well, Admiral, in a general way, what I want
in a manner of speaking is money and rum. (<i>A
pause.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> David Pew, I have known you a long time.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> And so you have; aboard the old <i>Arethusa</i>; and
you don&rsquo;t seem that cheered up as I&rsquo;d looked for,
with a old shipmate dropping in, one as has been
seeking you two years and more&mdash;and blind at
that. Don&rsquo;t you remember the old chantie?&mdash;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">What a note you had to sing, what a swaller for a
pannikin of rum, and what a fist for the shiners.
Ah, Cap&rsquo;n, they didn&rsquo;t call you Admiral Guinea for
nothing. I can see that old sea-chest of yours&mdash;her
with the brass bands, where you kept your gold dust
and doubloons: you know!&mdash;I can see her as well
this minute as though you and me was still at it playing
pŭt on the lid of her.... You don&rsquo;t say nothing,
Cap&rsquo;n?... Well, here it is: I want money
and I want rum. You don&rsquo;t know what it is to want
rum, you don&rsquo;t: it gets to that p&rsquo;int that you would
kill a &rsquo;ole ship&rsquo;s company for just one guttle of it.
What? Admiral Guinea, my old Commander, go
back on poor old Pew? and him high and dry?
(Not you! When we had words over the negro lass
at Lagos, what did you do? fair dealings was your
word: fair as between man and man; and we had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"></a>164</span>
it out with p&rsquo;int and edge on Lagos sands. And you&rsquo;re
not going back on your word to me, now I&rsquo;m old and
blind! No, no! belay that, I say. Give me the old
motto: Fair dealings, as between man and man.)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> David Pew, it were better for you that you
were sunk in fifty fathom. I know your life; and
first and last, it is one broadside of wickedness. You
were a porter in a school, and beat a boy to death;
you ran for it, turned slaver, and shipped with me, a
green hand. Ay, that was the craft for you; that
was the right craft, and I was the right captain;
there was none worse that sailed to Guinea. Well,
what came of that? In five years&rsquo; time you made
yourself the terror and abhorrence of your messmates.
The worst hands detested you; your captain&mdash;that
was me, John Gaunt, the chief of sinners&mdash;cast you
out for a Jonah. (Who was it stabbed the Portuguese
and made off inland with his miserable wife? Who,
raging drunk on rum, clapped fire to the baracoons
and burned the poor soulless creatures in their chains?)
Ay, you were a scandal to the Guinea coast, from Lagos
down to Calabar; and when at last I sent you ashore,
a marooned man&mdash;your shipmates, devils as they were,
cheering and rejoicing to be quit of you&mdash;by heaven, it
was a ton&rsquo;s weight off the brig!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Cap&rsquo;n Gaunt, Cap&rsquo;n Gaunt, these are ugly words.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> What next? You shipped with Flint the Pirate.
What you did then I know not; the deep seas have
kept the secret; kept it, ay, and will keep against
the Great Day. God smote you with blindness, but
you heeded not the sign. That was His last mercy;
look for no more. To your knees, man, and repent.
Pray for a new heart; flush out your sins with tears;
flee while you may from the terrors of the wrath to come.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Now, I want this clear: Do I understand that
you&rsquo;re going back on me, and you&rsquo;ll see me damned
first?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>165</span>
<span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Of me you shall have neither money nor strong
drink: not a guinea to spend in riot; not a drop to
fire your heart with devilry.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Cap&rsquo;n, do you think it wise to quarrel with me?
I put it to you now, Cap&rsquo;n, fairly, as between man
and man&mdash;do you think it wise?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> I fear nothing. My feet are on the Rock. Be-gone!
(<i>He opens the Bible and begins to read.</i>)</p>

<p>Pew (<i>after a pause</i>). Well, Cap&rsquo;n, you know best, no
doubt; and David Pew&rsquo;s about the last man, though
I says it, to up and thwart an old Commander. You&rsquo;ve
been &rsquo;ard on David Pew, Cap&rsquo;n: &rsquo;ard on the poor blind;
but you&rsquo;ll live to regret it&mdash;ah, my Christian friend,
you&rsquo;ll live to eat them words up. But there&rsquo;s no malice
here: that ain&rsquo;t Pew&rsquo;s way; here&rsquo;s a sailor&rsquo;s hand
upon it.... You don&rsquo;t say nothing? (<i><span class="sc">Gaunt</span>

<p class="ct"><i><span class="sc">Pew</span>; afterwards <span class="sc">Mrs. Drake</span>, out and in</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew</span> (<i>entering</i>). Kind Christian friends&mdash;&mdash;(<i>listening,
then dropping the whine</i>). Hey? nobody! Hey? A
grog-shop not two cable-lengths from the Admiral&rsquo;s
back-door, and the Admiral not there? I never
knew a seaman brought so low: he ain&rsquo;t but the
bones of the man he used to be. Bear away for
the New Jerusalem, and this is what you run aground
on, is it? Good again; but it ain&rsquo;t Pew&rsquo;s way;
Pew&rsquo;s way is rum.&mdash;Sanded floor. Rum is his word,
and rum his motion.&mdash;Settle&mdash;chimbly&mdash;settle again&mdash;spittoon&mdash;table
rigged for supper. Table&mdash;glass.
(<i>Drinks heeltap.</i>) Brandy and water; and not
enough of it to wet your eye; damn all greediness,
I say. Pot (<i>drinks</i>), small beer&mdash;a drink that I
ab&rsquo;or like bilge! What I want is rum. (<i>Calling and
rapping with stick on table.</i>) Halloa, there! House,
ahoy!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake</span> (<i>without</i>). Coming, sir, coming. (<i>She enters,
R.</i>) What can I do&mdash;&mdash;? (<i>Seeing <span class="sc">Pew</span>.</i>) Well, I
never did! Now, beggar-man, what&rsquo;s for you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167"></a>167</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Rum, ma&rsquo;am, rum; and a bit o&rsquo; supper.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> And a bed to follow, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> <i>And</i> a bed to follow: <i>if</i> you please.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> This is the &ldquo;Admiral Benbow,&rdquo; a respectable
house, and receives none but decent company;
and I&rsquo;ll ask you to go somewhere else, for I don&rsquo;t like
the looks of you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Turn me away? Why, Lord love you, I&rsquo;m David
Pew&mdash;old David Pew&mdash;him as was Benbow&rsquo;s own
particular cox&rsquo;n. You wouldn&rsquo;t turn away old Pew
from the sign of his late commander&rsquo;s &rsquo;ed? Ah, my
British female, you&rsquo;d have used me different if you&rsquo;d
seen me in the fight! (There laid old Benbow, both his
legs shot off, in a basket, and the blessed spy-glass at
his eye to that same hour: a picter, ma&rsquo;am, of naval
daring: when a round shot come, and took and knocked
a bucketful of shivers right into my poor daylights.
&ldquo;Damme,&rdquo; says the Admiral, &ldquo;is that old Pew, <i>my</i>
old Pew?&rdquo; he says.&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s old Pew, sir,&rdquo; says the first
lootenant, &ldquo;worse luck,&rdquo; he says.&mdash;&ldquo;Then damme,&rdquo;
says Admiral Benbow, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s how they serve a
lion-&rsquo;arted seaman, damme if I care to live,&rdquo; he says;
and, ma&rsquo;am, he laid down his spy-glass.)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> Blind man, I don&rsquo;t fancy you, and that&rsquo;s
the truth; and I&rsquo;ll thank you to take yourself off.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Thirty years have I fought for country and king,
and now in my blind old age I&rsquo;m to be sent packing
from a measly public-&rsquo;ouse? Mark ye, ma&rsquo;am, if I
go, you take the consequences. Is this a inn? Or
hain&rsquo;t it? If it is a inn, then by act of parleyment,
I&rsquo;m free to sling my &rsquo;ammick. Don&rsquo;t you forget: this
is a act of parleyment job, this is. You look out.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> Why, what&rsquo;s to do with the man and
his acts of parliament? I don&rsquo;t want to fly in the
face of an act of parliament, not I. If what you say
is true&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> True? If there&rsquo;s anything truer than a act of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168"></a>168</span>
parleyment&mdash;Ah! you ask the beak. True? I&rsquo;ve
that in my &rsquo;art as makes me wish it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> I don&rsquo;t like to risk it. I don&rsquo;t like your
looks, and you&rsquo;re more sea-lawyer than seaman to my
mind. But I&rsquo;ll tell you what: if you can pay, you
can stay. So there.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> No chink, no drink? That&rsquo;s your motto, is it?
Well, that&rsquo;s sense. Now, look here, ma&rsquo;am, I ain&rsquo;t
beautiful like you; but I&rsquo;m good, and I&rsquo;ll give you
warrant for it. Get me a noggin of rum, and suthin&rsquo;
to scoff, and a penny pipe, and a half-a-foot of baccy;
and there&rsquo;s a guinea for the reckoning. There&rsquo;s plenty
more in the locker; so bear a hand, and be smart. I
don&rsquo;t like waiting; it ain&rsquo;t my way. (<i>Exit <span class="sc">Mrs. Drake</span>,
R. <span class="sc">Pew</span> sits at the table, R. The settle conceals him
from the upper part of the stage.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake</span> (<i>re-entering</i>). Here&rsquo;s the rum, sailor.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew</span> (<i>drinks</i>). Ah, rum! That&rsquo;s my sheet-anchor; rum
and the blessed Gospel. Don&rsquo;t you forget that, ma&rsquo;am:
rum and the Gospel is old Pew&rsquo;s sheet-anchor. You
can take for another while you&rsquo;re about it; and, I
say, short reckonings make long friends, hey? Where&rsquo;s
my change?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> I&rsquo;m counting it now. There, there it is,
and thank you for your custom. (<i>She goes out, R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew</span> (<i>calling after her</i>). Don&rsquo;t thank me, ma&rsquo;am; thank
the act of parleyment! Rum, fourpence; two penny
pieces and a Willi&rsquo;m-and-Mary tizzy makes a shilling;
and a spade half-guinea is eleven and six (<i>re-enter <span class="sc">Mrs.
Drake</span> with supper, pipe, etc.</i>); and a blessed majesty
George the First crown-piece makes sixteen and six;
and two shilling bits is eighteen and six; and a new
half-crown makes&mdash;no it don&rsquo;t! O no! Old Pew&rsquo;s
too smart a hand to be bammed with a soft tusheroon.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake</span> (<i>changing piece</i>). I&rsquo;m sure I didn&rsquo;t know it,
sailor.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew</span> (<i>trying new coin between his teeth</i>). In course you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169"></a>169</span>
didn&rsquo;t, my dear; but I did, and I thought I&rsquo;d mention it.
Is that my supper, hey? Do my nose deceive me?
(<i>Sniffing and feeling.</i>) Cold duck? sage and onions?
a round of double Gloster? and that noggin o&rsquo; rum?
Why, I declare if I&rsquo;d stayed and took pot-luck with my
old commander, Cap&rsquo;n John Gaunt, he couldn&rsquo;t have
beat this little spread, as I&rsquo;ve got by act of parleyment.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake</span> (<i>at knitting</i>). Do you know the captain,
sailor?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Know him? I was that man&rsquo;s bo&rsquo;sun, ma&rsquo;am. In
the Guinea trade, we was known as &ldquo;Pew&rsquo;s Cap&rsquo;n&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Gaunt&rsquo;s Bo&rsquo;sun,&rdquo; one for the other like. We
was like two brothers, ma&rsquo;am. And a excellent cold
duck, to be sure; and the rum lovely.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> If you know John Gaunt, you know his
daughter Arethusa.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> What? Arethusa? Know her, says you? know
her? Why, Lord love you, I was her godfather.
(&ldquo;Pew,&rdquo; says Jack Gaunt to me, &ldquo;Pew,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re a man,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;I like a man to be a man,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;and damme,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I like <i>you</i>; and sink
me,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t promise and vow in the
name of that new-born babe,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;why, damme,
Pew,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not the man I take you for.&rdquo;)
Yes, ma&rsquo;am, I named that female; with my own &rsquo;ands
I did; Arethusa I named her; that was the name I give
her; so now you know if I speak true. And if you&rsquo;ll
be as good as get me another noggin of rum, why, we&rsquo;ll
drink her &rsquo;elth with three times three. (<i>Exit <span class="sc">Mrs.
Drake; Pew</span> eating; <span class="sc">Mrs. Drake</span> re-entering with
rum.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> If what you say be true, sailor (and I don&rsquo;t
say it isn&rsquo;t, mind!), it&rsquo;s strange that Arethusa and that
godly man her father have never so much as spoke
your name.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Why, that&rsquo;s so! And why, says you? Why,
when I dropped in and paid my respecks this morning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>170</span>
do you think she knew me? No more&rsquo;n a babe unborn!
Why, ma&rsquo;am, when I promised and vowed for her, I
was the picter of a man-o&rsquo;war&rsquo;s man, I was: eye like
a eagle; walked the deck in a hornpipe, foot up and
foot down; v&rsquo;ice as mellow as rum; &rsquo;and upon &rsquo;art,
and all the females took dead aback at the first sight,
Lord bless &rsquo;em! Know me? Not likely. And as for
me, when I found her such a lovely woman&mdash;by the feel
of her &rsquo;and and arm!&mdash;you might have knocked me
down with a feather. But here&rsquo;s where it is, you see:
when you&rsquo;ve been knocking about on blue water for a
matter of two and forty year, shipwrecked here, and
blown up there, and everywhere out of luck, and given
over for dead by all your messmates and relations, why,
what it amounts to is this: nobody knows you, and you
hardly knows yourself, and there you are; and I&rsquo;ll
trouble you for another noggin of rum.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> I think you&rsquo;ve had enough.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> I don&rsquo;t; so bear a hand. (<i>Exit <span class="sc">Mrs. Drake;
Pew</span> empties the glass.</i>) Rum, ah, rum, you&rsquo;re a lovely
creature; they haven&rsquo;t never done you justice. (<i>Proceeds
to fill and light pipe; re-enter <span class="sc">Mrs. Drake</span> with
rum.</i>) And now, ma&rsquo;am, since you&rsquo;re so genteel and
amicable-like, what about my old commander? Is
he, in a manner of speaking, on half pay? or is he
living on his fortune, like a gentleman slaver
ought?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> Well, sailor, people talk, you know.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> I know, ma&rsquo;am; I&rsquo;d have been rolling in my coach,
if they&rsquo;d have held their tongues.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> And they do say that Captain Gaunt, for so
pious a man, is little better than a miser.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Don&rsquo;t say it, ma&rsquo;am; not to old Pew. Ah, how
often have I up and strove with him! &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n, live
it down,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Ah, Pew,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a
better man than I am,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;but damme,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;money,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is like rum to me.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>171</span>
(<i>Insinuating.</i>) And what about a old sea-chest, hey?
a old sea-chest, strapped with brass bands?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> Why, that&rsquo;ll be the chest in his parlour,
where he has it bolted to the wall, as I&rsquo;ve seen with
my own eyes; and so might you, if you had eyes to
see with.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> No, ma&rsquo;am, that ain&rsquo;t good enough; you don&rsquo;t
bam old Pew. You never was in that parlour in your
life.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> I never was! Well, I declare!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Well, then, if you was, where&rsquo;s the chest? Beside
the chimbley, hey? (<i>Winking.</i>) Beside the table
with the &rsquo;oly Bible?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> No, sailor, you don&rsquo;t get any information
out of me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> What, ma&rsquo;am? Not to old Pew? Why, my god-child
showed it me herself, and I told her where she&rsquo;d
find my name&mdash;P, E, W, Pew&mdash;cut out on the stern
of it; and sure enough she did. Why, ma&rsquo;am, it was his
old money-box when he was in the Guinea trade; and
they do say he keeps the rhino in it still.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> No, sailor, nothing out of me! And if
you want to know, you can ask the Admiral himself!
(<i>She crosses, L.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Hey? Old girl fly? Then I reckon I must have a
mate, if it was the parish bull.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Crying? Arethusa cry? Why, dame, she&rsquo;s the
bravest-hearted girl in all broad England! Here, fill
the glass! I&rsquo;ll win her yet. I drink to her; here&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"></a>173</span>
to her bright eyes, and here&rsquo;s to the blessed feet she
walks upon!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew</span> (<i>looking round the corner of the settle</i>). Spoke like a
gallant seaman, every inch. Shipmate, I&rsquo;m a man as
has suffered, and I&rsquo;d like to shake your fist, and drink
a can of flip with you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit</span> (<i>coming down</i>). Hullo, my hearty! who the devil
are you? Who&rsquo;s this, mother?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> Nay, I know nothing about him. (<i>She
goes out, R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Cap&rsquo;n, I&rsquo;m a brother seaman, and my name is Pew,
old David Pew, as you may have heard of in your
time, he having sailed along of &rsquo;Awke and glorious
Benbow, and a right-&rsquo;and man to both.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Benbow? Steady, mate! D&rsquo;ye mean to say you
went to sea before you were born?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> See now! The sign of this here inn was running in
my &rsquo;ed, I reckon. Benbow, says you? no, not likely!
Anson, I mean; Anson and Sir Edward &rsquo;Awke: that&rsquo;s
the pair: I was their right-&rsquo;and man.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Well, mate, you may be all that, and more; but you&rsquo;re
a rum &rsquo;un to look at, anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Right you are, and so I am. But what is looks?
It&rsquo;s the &rsquo;art that does it: the &rsquo;art is the seaman&rsquo;s
star; and here&rsquo;s old David Pew&rsquo;s a matter of fifty
years at sea, but tough and sound as the British
Constitootion.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> You&rsquo;re right there, Pew. Shake hands upon it.
And you&rsquo;re a man they&rsquo;re down upon, just like myself,
I see. We&rsquo;re a pair of plain, good-hearted, jolly tars;
and all these &rsquo;longshore fellows cock a lip at us, by
George. What cheer, mate?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa</span> (<i>without</i>). Mrs. Drake! Mrs. Drake!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> What, a female? hey? a female? Board her,
board her, mate! I&rsquo;m dark. (<i>He retires again behind,
to table, R., behind settle.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa</span> (<i>without</i>). Mrs. Drake!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>174</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake</span> (<i>re-entering and running to door</i>). Here I am,
my dear; come in.</p>

<h4>SCENE III</h4>

<p class="ct"><i>To these, <span class="sc">Arethusa</span></i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Ah, Kit, I&rsquo;ve found you. I thought you would
lodge with Mrs. Drake.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> What? are you looking for your consort? Whistle,
I&rsquo;m your dog; I&rsquo;ll come to you. I&rsquo;ve been toasting
you fathom deep, my beauty; and with every glass
I love you dearer.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Now, Kit, if you want to please my father,
this is not the way. Perhaps he thinks too much
of the guineas: well, gather them&mdash;if you think me
worth the price. Go you to your sloop, clinker built,
eighty tons burthen&mdash;you see I remember. Skipper
Kit! I don&rsquo;t deny I like a man of spirit; but if you
care to please Captain Gaunt, keep out of taverns; and
if you could carry yourself a bit more&mdash;more elderly!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Can I? Would I? Ah, just couldn&rsquo;t and just
won&rsquo;t I, then!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> I hope, madam, you don&rsquo;t refer to my
house; a publican I may be, but tavern is a word
that I don&rsquo;t hold with; and here there&rsquo;s no bad drink,
and no loose company; and as for my blessedest Kit,
I declare I love him like my own.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Why, who could help it, Mrs. Drake?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Arethusa, you&rsquo;re an angel. Do I want to please
Captain Gaunt? Why, that&rsquo;s as much as ask whether
I love you. (I don&rsquo;t deny that his words cut me;
for they did. But as for wanting to please him, if
he was deep as the blue Atlantic, I would beat it
out. And elderly, too? Aha, you witch, you&rsquo;re
wise! Elderly? You&rsquo;ve set the course; you leave
me alone to steer it. Matrimony&rsquo;s my port, and love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175"></a>175</span>
is my cargo.) That&rsquo;s a likely question, ain&rsquo;t it, Mrs.
Drake? Do I want to please him! Elderly, says
you? Why, see here: Fill up my glass, and I&rsquo;ll drink
to Arethusa on my knees.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Why, you stupid boy, do you think that
would please him?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> On my knees I&rsquo;ll drink it! (<i>As he kneels and drains
the glass, <span class="sc">Gaunt</span> enters, and he scrambles to his feet.</i>)</p>





<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE IV</h4>

<p class="ct"><i>To these, <span class="sc">Gaunt</span></i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Arethusa, this is no place for you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> No, father.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> I wish you had been spared this sight; but look
at him, child, since you are here; look at God&rsquo;s image,
so debased. And you, young man (<i>to <span class="sc">Kit</span></i>), you have
proved that I was right. Are you the husband for this
innocent maid?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Captain Gaunt, I have a word to say to you. Terror
is your last word; you&rsquo;re bitter hard upon poor sinners,
bitter hard and black&mdash;you that were a sinner yourself.
These are not the true colours; don&rsquo;t deceive yourself;
you&rsquo;re out of your course.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Heaven forbid that I should be hard, Christopher.
It is not I; it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s law that is of iron. Think! if
the blow were to fall now, some cord to snap within
you, some enemy to plunge a knife into your heart;
this room, with its poor taper light, to vanish; this
world to disappear like a drowning man into the great
ocean; and you, your brain still whirling, to be snatched
into the presence of the Eternal Judge: Christopher
French, what answer would you make? For these
gifts wasted, for this rich mercy scorned, for these high-handed
bravings of your better angel&mdash;what have you
to say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page176"></a>176</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Well, sir, I want my word with you, and by your
leave I&rsquo;ll have it out.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Kit, for pity&rsquo;s sake!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Arethusa, I don&rsquo;t speak to you, my dear: you&rsquo;ve
got my ring, and I know what that means. The
man I speak to is Captain Gaunt. I came to-day as
happy a man as ever stepped, and with as fair a lookout.
What did you care? what was your reply?
None of your flesh and blood, you said, should lie at the
mercy of a wretch like me! Am I not flesh and blood
that you should trample on me like that? Is that
charity, to stamp the hope out of a poor soul?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> You speak wildly; or the devil of drink that is
in you speaks instead.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> You think me drunk; well, so I am, and whose
fault is it but yours? It was I that drank; but you
take your share of it, Captain Gaunt: you it was that
filled the can.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Christopher French, I spoke but for your good,
your good and hers. &ldquo;Woe unto him&rdquo;&mdash;these are the
dreadful words&mdash;&ldquo;by whom offences shall come: it were
better&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Christopher, I can but pray for both of us.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Prayers? Now I tell you freely, Captain Gaunt,
I don&rsquo;t value your prayers. Deeds are what I ask;
kind deeds and words&mdash;that&rsquo;s the true-blue piety:
to hope the best and do the best, and speak the kindest.
As for you, you insult me to my face; and then you&rsquo;ll
pray for me? What&rsquo;s that? Insult behind my back
is what I call it! No, sir; you&rsquo;re out of the courses;
you&rsquo;re no good man to my view, be you who you may.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> O Christopher! To Captain Gaunt?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Father, father, come away!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Ah, you see? She suffers too; we all suffer. You
spoke just now of a devil; well, I&rsquo;ll tell you the devil
you have: the devil of judging others. And as for me,
I&rsquo;ll get as drunk as Bacchus.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Come! (<i>Exit, with <span class="sc">Arethusa</span>.</i>)</p>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Pew, Mrs. Drake, Kit</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> (<i>coming out and waving his pipe</i>). Commander,
shake! Hooray for old England! If there&rsquo;s anything
in the world that goes to old Pew&rsquo;s &rsquo;art, it&rsquo;s
argyment. Commander, you handled him like a babby,
kept the weather gauge, and hulled him every shot.
Commander, give it a name, and let that name be rum!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Ay, rum&rsquo;s the sailor&rsquo;s fancy. Mrs. Drake, a bottle
and clean glasses.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> Kit French, I wouldn&rsquo;t. Think better of it,
there&rsquo;s a dear! And that sweet girl just gone!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m not a &rsquo;ard man; I&rsquo;m not the man
to up and force a act of parleyment upon a helpless
female. But you see here: Pew&rsquo;s friends is sacred.
Here&rsquo;s my friend here, a perfeck seaman, and a man
with a &rsquo;ed upon his shoulders, and a man that, damme,
I admire. He give you a order, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;march!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> Kit, don&rsquo;t you listen to that blind man;
he&rsquo;s the devil wrote upon his face.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Don&rsquo;t you insinuate against my friend. <i>He</i> ain&rsquo;t
a child, I hope? <i>he</i> knows his business? Don&rsquo;t you
get trying to go a-lowering of my friend in his own
esteem.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> Well, I&rsquo;ll bring it, Kit; but it&rsquo;s against
the grain. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> I say, old boy, come to think of it, why should we?
It&rsquo;s been glasses round with me all day. I&rsquo;ve got

Guinea? O stash that! <i>I</i> stand treat, if it comes
to that!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> What! Do I meet with a blind seaman and not
stand him? That&rsquo;s not the man I am!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake</span> (<i>re-entering with bottle and glasses</i>). There!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>178</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Easy does it, ma&rsquo;am.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Mrs. Drake, you had better trot.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> Yes, I&rsquo;ll trot; and I&rsquo;ll trot with a sick
heart, Kit French, to leave you drinking your wits
away with that low blind man. For a low man you
are&mdash;a low blind man&mdash;and your clothes they would
disgrace a scarecrow. I&rsquo;ll go to my bed, Kit; and
O, dear boy, go soon to yours&mdash;the old room, you
know; it&rsquo;s ready for you&mdash;and go soon and sleep it off;
for you know, dear, they, one and all, regret it in the
morning; thirty years I&rsquo;ve kept this house, and one
and all they did regret it, dear.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Come now, you walk!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Drake.</span> O, it&rsquo;s not for your bidding. You a seaman?
The ship for you to sail in is the hangman&rsquo;s

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> So she is, Commander. But there&rsquo;s no woman

Shake hands, Pew; and we&rsquo;ll make a night of it, or

see here: argyment&rsquo;s my weakness, in a manner of

not for gold untold, no, not for rum, I wouldn&rsquo;t!
And besides, Commander, I put it to you as between
man and man, would it have been seaman-like to let
on and show myself to a old shipmate, when he was
yard-arm to yard-arm with a craft not half his metal,
and getting blown out of water every broadside?
Would it have been &rsquo;ansome? I put it to you, as

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Pew, I may have gifts; but I never thought of that.
Why, no: not seaman-like. Pew, you&rsquo;ve a heart,

Guinea. Why? says you. Well, put it that I know
a fine young fellow when I sees him; and put it that
I wish him well; and put it, for the sake of argyment,
that the father of that lovely female&rsquo;s in my power.
Aha? Pew&rsquo;s power! Why, in my &rsquo;ands he&rsquo;s like

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Ay, that I do; but I&rsquo;m not fit for her, Pew; I&rsquo;m
a drunken dog, and I&rsquo;m not fit for her.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Now, Cap&rsquo;n, you&rsquo;ll allow a old seaman to be judge:

it being the case that you&rsquo;re hard hit about a lovely
woman, which many a time and oft it has happened
to old Pew; and him with a feeling &rsquo;art that bleeds
for you, Commander; why, look here: I&rsquo;m that girl&rsquo;s
godfather; promised and vowed for her, I did; and
I like you; and you&rsquo;re the man for her; and, by the

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> No, not to-night, Pew, not to-night!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Commander, in a manner of speaking, wherefore?</p>

do it, I don&rsquo;t know; but I&rsquo;ll stand by; and I know you&rsquo;ll
do it if anybody can. But I&rsquo;m drunk, Pew, you can&rsquo;t
deny that; I&rsquo;m as drunk as a Plymouth fiddler, Pew;
and how you&rsquo;re going to do it is a mystery to me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Ah, you leave that to me. All I want is what I&rsquo;ve
got: your promise to stand by and bear a hand (<i>producing
a dark lantern</i>). Now, here, you see, is my little
glim; it ain&rsquo;t for me, because I&rsquo;m blind, worse luck!
and the day and night is the blessed same to David
Pew. But you watch. You put the candle near me.
Here&rsquo;s what there ain&rsquo;t many blind men could do, take
the pick o&rsquo; them! (<i>lighting a screw of paper, and with
that, the lantern</i>). Hey? That&rsquo;s it. Hey? Go and
pity the poor blind!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit</span> (<i>while <span class="sc">Pew</span> blows out the candles</i>). But I say, Pew, what
do you want with it?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> To see by, my son. (<i>He shuts the lantern and puts
it in his pocket. Stage quite dark. Moonlight at window.</i>)
All ship-shape? No sparks about? No? Come, then,
lean on me and heave ahead for the lovely female.

<h3>ACT III</h3>

<div class="quote">
<p><i>The Stage represents the Admiral&rsquo;s house, as in Act I. <span class="sc">Gaunt</span>,
seated, is reading aloud; <span class="sc">Arethusa</span> sits at his feet. Candles</i></p>

<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Arethusa, Gaunt</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt</span> (<i>reading</i>). &ldquo;And Ruth said, Intreat me not to
leave thee, or to return from following after thee:
for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou
lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people,
and thy God my God: where thou diest, will I die,
and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and
more also, if ought but death part thee and me.&rdquo; (<i>He
closes the book.</i>) Amen.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Amen. Father, there spoke my heart.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Arethusa, the Lord in His mercy has seen right
to vex us with trials of many kinds. It is a little
matter to endure the pangs of the flesh, the smart
of wounds, the passion of hunger and thirst, the heaviness
of disease; and in this world I have learned to take
thought for nothing save the quiet of your soul. It is
through our affections that we are smitten with the true
pain, even the pain that kills.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> And yet this pain is our natural lot. Father,
I fear to boast, but I know that I can bear it. Let
my life, then, flow like common lives, each pain rewarded
with some pleasure, each pleasure linked with
some pain: nothing pure whether for good or evil:
and my husband, like myself and all the rest of us,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>185</span>
only a poor, kind-hearted sinner, striving for the better
part. What more could any woman ask?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Child, child, your words are like a sword. What
would she ask? Look upon me whom, in the earthly
sense, you are commanded to respect. Look upon me:
do I bear a mark? is there any outward sign to bid
a woman avoid and flee from me?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> I see nothing but the face I love.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> There is none: nor yet on the young man Christopher,
whose words still haunt and upbraid me. Yes,
I am hard; I was born hard, born a tyrant, born to be
what I was, a slaver captain. But to-night, and to
save you, I will pluck my heart out of my bosom. You
shall know what makes me what I am; you shall hear,
out of my own life, why I dread and deprecate this
marriage. Child, do you remember your mother?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Remember her? Ah, if she had been here
to-day!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> It is thirteen years since she departed, and took
with her the whole sunshine of my life. Do you
remember the manner of her departure? You were a
child, and cannot; but I can and do. Remember?
shall I ever forget? Here or hereafter, ever forget!
Ten years she was my wife, and ten years she lay
a-dying. Arethusa, she was a saint on earth; and it
was I that killed her.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Killed her? my mother? You?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Not with my hand; for I loved her. I would
not have hurt one hair upon her head. But she got
her death by me, as sure as by a blow.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> I understand&mdash;I can see; you brood on
trifles, misunderstandings, unkindnesses you think them;
though my mother never knew of them, or never
gave them a second thought. It is natural when
death has come between.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> I married her from Falmouth. She was comely
as the roe; I see her still&mdash;her dove&rsquo;s eyes and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186"></a>186</span>
Smile! I was older than she; and I had a name for
hardness, a hard and wicked man; but she loved me&mdash;my
Hester!&mdash;and she took me as I was. O how I
repaid her trust! Well, our child was born to us;
and we named her after the brig I had built and sailed,
the old craft whose likeness&mdash;older than you, girl&mdash;stands
there above our heads. And so far, that was
happiness. But she yearned for my salvation; and
it was there I thwarted her. My sins were a burden
upon her spirit, a shame to her in this world, her
terror in the world to come. She talked much and
often of my leaving the devil&rsquo;s trade I sailed in. She
had a tender and a Christian heart, and she would
weep and pray for the poor heathen creatures that I
bought and sold and shipped in misery, till my conscience
grew hot within me. I&rsquo;ve put on my hat, and
gone out and made oath that my next cargo should be
my last; but it never was, that oath was never kept.
So I sailed again and again for the Guinea coast, until
the trip came that was to be my last indeed. Well, it
fell out that we had good luck trading, and I stowed
the brig with these poor heathen as full as she would
hold. We had a fair run westward till we were past the
line; but one night the wind rose, and there came a
hurricane, and for seven days we were tossed on the
deep seas, in the hardest straits, and every hand on
deck. For several days they were battened down:
all that time we heard their cries and lamentations, but
worse at the beginning; and when at last, and near
dead myself, I crept below&mdash;O, some they were starved,
some smothered, some dead of broken limbs; and the
hold was like a lazar-house in the time of the anger of
the Lord!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> O!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> It was two hundred and five that we threw
overboard: two hundred and five lost souls that I
had hurried to their doom. I had many die with me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>187</span>
before; but not like that&mdash;not such a massacre as
that; and I stood dumb before the sight. For I
saw I was their murderer&mdash;body and soul their murderer
and, Arethusa, my Hester knew it. That
was her death-stroke: it felled her. She had long
been dying slowly; but from the hour she heard that
story, the garment of the flesh began to waste and
perish, the fountains of her life dried up; she faded
before my face; and in two months from my landing&mdash;O
Hester, Hester, would God I had died for thee!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Mother! O poor soul! O poor father!
O father, it was hard on you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> The night she died, she lay there, in her bed.
She took my hand. &ldquo;I am going,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to
heaven. For Christ&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;come after
me, and bring my little maid. I&rsquo;ll be waiting and
wearying till you come&rdquo;; and she kissed my hand,
the hand that killed her. At that I broke out, calling
on her to stop, for it was more than I could bear.
But no, she said she must still tell me of my sins,
and how the thought of them had bowed down her
life. &ldquo;And O!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if I couldn&rsquo;t prevail on
you alive, let my death.&rdquo;... Well, then, she
died. What have I done since then? I&rsquo;ve laid my
course for Hester. Sin, temptation, pleasure, all this
poor shadow of a world, I saw them not; I saw my
Hester waiting, waiting and wearying. I have made
my election sure; my sins I have cast them out.
Hester, Hester, I will come to you, poor waiting one;
and I&rsquo;ll bring your little maid: ay, dearest soul, I&rsquo;ll
bring your little maid safe with me!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> O teach me how! Show me the way! only
show me.&mdash;O mother, mother!&mdash;If it were paved with
fire, show me the way, and I will walk it barefoot!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> They call me a miser. They say that in this
sea-chest of mine I hoard my gold. (<i>He passes R.
to chest, takes out key and unlocks it.</i>) They think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188"></a>188</span>
my treasure and my very soul are locked up here.
They speak after the flesh, but they are right. See!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Her watch? the wedding ring? O father,
forgive me!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Ay, her watch that counted the hours when I
was away; they were few and sorrowful, my Hester&rsquo;s
hours; and this poor contrivance numbered them.
The ring&mdash;with that I married her. This chain, it&rsquo;s
of Guinea gold; I brought it home for her, the year
before we married, and she wore it to her wedding.
It was a vanity: they are all vanities; but they are
the treasure of my soul. Below here, see, her wedding
dress. Ay, the watch has stopped: dead, dead. And
I know that my Hester died of me; and day and
night, asleep and awake, my soul abides in her remembrance.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> And you come in your sleep to look at them.
O, poor father! I understand&mdash;I understand you
now.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> In my sleep? Ay? do I so? My Hester!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> And why, why did you not tell me? I
thought&mdash;I was like the rest!&mdash;I feared you were
a miser. O, you should have told me; I should
have been so proud&mdash;so proud and happy. I knew
you loved her; but not this, not this.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Why should I have spoken? It was all between
my Hester and me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Father, may I speak? May I tell you what
my heart tells me? You do not understand about
my mother. You loved her&mdash;O, as few men can love.
And she loved you: think how she loved you! In
this world, you know&mdash;you have told me&mdash;there is
nothing perfect. All we men and women have our
sins; and they are a pain to those that love us, and
the deeper the love, the crueller the pain. That
is life; and it is life we ask, not heaven; and what
matter for the pain, if only the love holds on? Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189"></a>189</span>
love held: then she was happy. Her love was immortal;
and when she died, her one grief was to be parted
from you, her one hope to welcome you again.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> And you, Arethusa: I was to bring her little
maid.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> God bless her, yes, and me! But, father, can
you not see that she was blessed among women?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Child, child, you speak in ignorance; you touch
upon griefs you cannot fathom.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> No, dearest, no. She loved you, loved you
and died of it. Why else do women live? What
would I ask but just to love my Kit, and die for him,
and look down from heaven, and see him keep my
memory holy and live the nobler for my sake?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Ay, do you so love him?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Even as my mother loved my father.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Ay? Then we will see. What right have
I&mdash;&mdash;You are your mother&rsquo;s child: better, tenderer,
wiser than I. Let us seek guidance in prayer. Good-night,
my little maid.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> O father, I know you at last.</p>

<h4>SCENE II</h4>

<p><i><span class="sc">Gaunt</span> and <span class="sc">Arethusa</span> go out L., carrying the candles.
Stage dark. A distant clock chimes the quarters, and
strikes one. Then the tap-tapping of Pew&rsquo;s stick is
heard without; the key is put into the lock; and enter
<span class="sc">Pew</span>, C.; he pockets key, and is followed by <span class="sc">Kit</span>, with
dark lantern</i></p>
<div style="padding-top: 0.5em; ">&nbsp;</div>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Quiet, you lubber! Can&rsquo;t you foot it soft, you
that has daylights and a glim?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> All right, old boy. How the devil did we get through
the door? Shall I knock him up?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Stow your gab (<i>seizing his wrist</i>). Under your
breath!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"></a>190</span>
<span class="sc">Kit.</span> Avast that! You&rsquo;re a savage dog, aren&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Turn on that glim.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> It&rsquo;s as right as a trivet, Pew. What next? By
George, Pew, I&rsquo;ll make your fortune.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Here, now, look round this room, and sharp. D&rsquo;ye
see a old sea-chest?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> See it, Pew? why, d&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;m blind?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Take me across, and let me feel of her. Mum;
catch my hand. Ah, that&rsquo;s her (<i>feeling the chest</i>),
that&rsquo;s the Golden Mary. Now, see here, my bo, if
you&rsquo;ve the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit, this girl
is yours; if you hain&rsquo;t, and think to sheer off, I&rsquo;m
blind, but I&rsquo;m deadly.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> You&rsquo;ll keep a civil tongue in your head all the same.
I&rsquo;ll take threats from nobody, blind or not. Let&rsquo;s
knock up the Admiral and be done with it. What I
want is to get rid of this dark lantern. It makes me
feel like a housebreaker, by George.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew</span> (<i>seated on chest</i>). You follow this. I&rsquo;m sick of
drinking bilge, when I might be rolling in my coach,
and I&rsquo;m dog-sick of Jack Gaunt. Who&rsquo;s he to be
wallowing in gold, when a better man is groping crusts
in the gutter and spunging for rum? Now, here, in
this blasted chest, is the gold to make men of us for
life: gold, ay, gobs of it; and writin&rsquo;s too&mdash;things
that if I had the proof of &rsquo;em I&rsquo;d hold Jack Gaunt to the
grindstone till his face was flat. I&rsquo;d have done it
single-handed; but I&rsquo;m blind, worse luck: I&rsquo;m all in
the damned dark here, poking with a stick&mdash;Lord, burn
up with lime the eyes that saw it! That&rsquo;s why I raked
up you. Come, out with your iron, and prise the lid
off. You shall touch your snack, and have the wench
for nothing; ay, and fling her in the street, when done.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> So you brought me here to steal, did you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Ay did I; and you shall. I&rsquo;m a biter: I bring
blood.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Now, Pew, you came here on my promise, or I&rsquo;d
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"></a>191</span>
kill you like a rat. As it is, out of that door! One,
two, three (<i>drawing his cutlass</i>), and off!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew</span> (<i>leaping at his throat and with a great voice</i>). Help!
murder! thieves!</p>





<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>SCENE III</h4>

<p class="ct"><i>To these, <span class="sc">Arethusa</span>, <span class="sc">Gaunt</span>, with lights. Stage light,
<span class="sc">Pew</span> has <span class="sc">Kit</span> down, and is throttling him</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> I&rsquo;ve got him, Cap&rsquo;n. What, kill my old commander,
and rob him of his blessed child? Not with
old Pew!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Get up, David; can&rsquo;t you see you&rsquo;re killing him?
Unhand, I say.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> In heaven&rsquo;s name, who is it?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> It&rsquo;s a damned villain, my pretty; and his name, to
the best of my belief, is French.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Kit? Kit French? Never.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit</span> (<i>rising</i>). He&rsquo;s done for me. (<i>Falls on chest.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Don&rsquo;t you take on about him, ducky; he ain&rsquo;t
worth it. Cap&rsquo;n Gaunt, I took him and I give him
up. You was &rsquo;ard on me this morning, Cap&rsquo;n: this
is my way&mdash;Pew&rsquo;s way, this is&mdash;of paying of you out.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Father, this is the blind man that came
while you were abroad. Sure you&rsquo;ll not listen to
<i>him</i>. And you, Kit, you, what is this?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Captain Gaunt, that blind devil has half-throttled
me. He brought me here&mdash;I can&rsquo;t speak&mdash;he has almost
killed me&mdash;and I&rsquo;d been drinking too.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> And you, David Pew, what do you say?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Cap&rsquo;n, the rights of it is this. Me and that young
man there was partaking in a friendly drop of rum
at the &ldquo;Admiral Benbow&rdquo; inn; and I&rsquo;d just proposed
his blessed Majesty, when the young man he ups
and says to me: &ldquo;Pew,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I like you, Pew:
you&rsquo;re a true seaman,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m one as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"></a>192</span>
sticks at nothing; and damme, Pew,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
make your fortune.&rdquo; (Can he deny as them was his
words? Look at him, you as has eyes: no, he cannot.
&ldquo;Come along of me,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and, damme, I&rsquo;ll make
your fortune.&rdquo;) Well, Cap&rsquo;n, he lights a dark lantern
(which you&rsquo;ll find it somewhere on the floor, I reckon),
and out we goes, me follerin&rsquo; his lead, as I thought was
&rsquo;art-of-oak and a true-blue mariner; and the next I
knows is, here we was in here, and him a-askin&rsquo; me to
&rsquo;old the glim, while he prised the lid off of your old
sea-chest with his cutlass.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> The chest? (<i>He leaps, R., and examines chest.</i>) Ah!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Leastways, I was to &rsquo;elp him, by his account of it,
while he nailed the rhino, and then took and carried
off that lovely maid of yours; for a lovely maid she
is, and one as touched old Pew&rsquo;s &rsquo;art. Cap&rsquo;n, when
I &rsquo;eard that, my blood biled. &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; I says,
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know David Pew,&rdquo; I says; and with that
I ups and does my dooty by him, cutlass and all, like
a lion-&rsquo;arted seaman, though blind. (And then in
comes you, and I gives him up: as you know for a fack
is true, and I&rsquo;ll subscribe at the Assizes. And that,
if you was to cut me into junks, is the truth, the &rsquo;ole
truth, and nothing but the truth, world without end,
so help me, amen; and if you&rsquo;ll &rsquo;and me over the &rsquo;oly
Bible, me not having such a thing about me at the
moment, why, I&rsquo;ll put a oath upon it like a man.)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Father, have you heard?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> I know this man, Arethusa, and the truth is not
in him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Well, and why do we wait? We know Kit,
do we not?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Ay, Captain, you know the pair of us, and you can
see his face and mine.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Christopher, the facts are all against you. I
find you here in my house at midnight: you who at
least had eyes to see, and must have known whither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193"></a>193</span>
you were going. It was this man, not you, who
called me up: and when I came in, it was he who was
uppermost and who gave you up to justice. This
unsheathed cutlass is yours; there hangs the scabbard,
empty; and as for the dark lantern, of what use is
light to the blind? and who could have trimmed and
lighted it but you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Ah, Cap&rsquo;n, what a &rsquo;ed for argyment!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> And now, sir, now that you have spoken, I claim the
liberty to speak on my side.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Not so. I will first have done with this man.
David Pew, it were too simple to believe your story
as you tell it; but I can find no testimony against
you. From whatever reason, assuredly you have
done me service. Here are five guineas to set you on
your way. Begone at once; and while it is yet time,
think upon your repentance.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Pew.</span> Cap&rsquo;n, here&rsquo;s my respecks. You&rsquo;ve turned a pious
man, Cap&rsquo;n; it does my &rsquo;art good to &rsquo;ear you. But
you ain&rsquo;t the only one. O no! I came about and
paid off on the other tack before you, I reckon: you
ask the Chaplain of the Fleet else, as called me on
the quarter-deck before old Admiral &rsquo;Awke himself
(<i>touching his hat</i>), my old commander. (&ldquo;David
Pew,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;five-and-thirty year have I been in
this trade, man and boy,&rdquo; that chaplain says, &ldquo;and
damme, Pew,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;if ever I seen the seaman
that could rattle off his catechism within fifty mile
of you. Here&rsquo;s five guineas out of my own pocket,&rdquo;
he says; &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s more to the p&rsquo;int,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to my reverend brother-in-law, the Bishop
of Dover,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;and if ever you leave the sea,
and wants a place as beadle, why, damme,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;you go to him, for you&rsquo;re the man for him and him
for you.&rdquo;)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> David Pew, you never set your foot on a King&rsquo;s
ship in all your life. There lies the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page194"></a>194</span>
<span class="sc">Pew.</span> Ah, you was always a &rsquo;ard man, Cap&rsquo;n, and a &rsquo;ard
man to believe, like Didymus the &rsquo;Ebrew prophet.
But it&rsquo;s time for me to go, and I&rsquo;ll be going. My
service to you, Cap&rsquo;n: and I kiss my &rsquo;and to that
lovely female. (<i>Singing</i>)&mdash;</p>

<h4>SCENE IV</h4>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Kit, Arethusa, Gaunt</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Now, Kit?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Well, sir, and now?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> I find you here in my house at this untimely and
unseemly hour; I find you there in company with one
who, to my assured knowledge, should long since have
swung in the wind at Execution Dock. What brought
you? Why did you open my door while I slept to
such a companion? Christopher French, I have two
treasures. One (<i>laying his hand on <span class="sc">Arethusa&rsquo;s</span> shoulder</i>)
I know you covet: Christopher, is this your love?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Sir, I have been fooled and trapped. That man
declared he knew you, declared he could make you
change your mind about our marriage. I was drunk,
sir, and I believed him: heaven knows I am sober
now, and can see my folly; but I believed him then,
and followed him. He brought me here, he told me
your chest was full of gold that would make men of us
for life. At that I saw my fault, sir, and drew my
cutlass; and he, in the wink of an eye, roared out for
help, leaped at my throat like a weasel, and had me
rolling on the floor. He was quick, and I, as I tell you,
sir, was off my balance.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Is this man, Pew, your enemy?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> No, sir; I never saw him till to-night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195"></a>195</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Then, if you must stand the justice of your
country, come to the proof with a better plea. What?
lantern and cutlass yours; you the one that knew
the house; you the one that saw; you the one overtaken
and denounced; and you spin me a galley yarn
like that? If that is all your defence, you&rsquo;ll hang, sir,
hang.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Ah!... Father, I give him up: I will
never see him, never speak to him, never think of
him again; I take him from my heart; I give myself
wholly up to you and to my mother; I will obey
you in every point&mdash;O, not at a word merely&mdash;at a
finger raised! I will do all this; I will do anything&mdash;anything
you bid me; I swear it in the face of
heaven. Only&mdash;Kit! I love him, father, I love him.
Let him go.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Go?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> You let the other. Open the door again
for my sake, father&mdash;in my mother&rsquo;s name&mdash;O, open
the door and let him go.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Let me go? My girl, if you had cast me out this
morning, good and well: I would have left you,
though it broke my heart. But it&rsquo;s a changed story
now; now I&rsquo;m down on my luck, and you come and
stab me from behind. I ask no favour, and I&rsquo;ll take
none; I stand here on my innocence, and God helping
me I&rsquo;ll clear my good name, and get your love again,
if it&rsquo;s love worth having. Now, Captain Gaunt, I&rsquo;ve
said my say, and you may do your pleasure. I am
my father&rsquo;s son, and I never feared to face the truth.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> You have spoken like a man, French, and you
may go. I leave you free.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Nay, sir, not so: not with my will. I&rsquo;m accused
and counted guilty; the proofs are against me; the
girl I love has turned upon me. I&rsquo;ll accept no mercy at
your hands. Captain Gaunt, I am your prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Kit, dear Kit&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page196"></a>196</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Silence! Young man, I have offered you liberty
without bond or condition. You refuse. You shall
be judged. Meanwhile (<i>opening the door, R.</i>), you
will go in here. I keep your cutlass. The night brings
counsel: to-morrow shall decide. (<i>He locks <span class="sc">Kit</span> in,

<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Arethusa, Kit</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Come, dear Kit, come!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Well, I&rsquo;m here.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> O Kit, you are not angry with me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Have I reason to be pleased?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Kit, I was wrong. Forgive me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> O yes. I forgive you. I suppose you meant it
kindly; but there are some kindnesses a man would
rather die than take a gift of. When a man is accused,
Arethusa, it is not that he fears the gallows&mdash;it&rsquo;s the
shame that cuts him. At such a time as that, the way
to help was to stand to your belief. You should have
nailed my colours to the mast, not spoke of striking
them. If I were to be hanged to-morrow, and your
love there, and a free pardon and a dukedom on the
other side&mdash;which would I choose?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Kit, you must judge me fairly. It was not
my life that was at stake, it was yours. Had it been
mine&mdash;mine, Kit&mdash;what had you done, then?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> I am a downright fool; I saw it inside out. Why,
give you up, by George!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Ah, you see! Now you understand. It
was all pure love. When he said that word&mdash;O!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198"></a>198</span>
death and that disgrace!... But I know my
father. He fears nothing so much as the goodness
of his heart; and yet it conquers. He would pray,
he said; and to-night, and by the kindness of his voice,
I knew he was convinced already. All that is wanted
is that you should forgive me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Arethusa, if you looked at me like that I&rsquo;d forgive
you piracy on the high seas. I was only sulky; I
was boxed up there in the black dark, and couldn&rsquo;t
see my hand. It made me pity that blind man, by
George.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> O, that blind man! The fiend! He came
back, Kit: did you hear him? he thought we had
killed you&mdash;you!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Well, well, it serves me right for keeping company
with such a swab.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> One thing puzzles me: how did you get in?
I saw my father lock the door.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Ah, how? That&rsquo;s just it. I was a sheet in the
wind, you see. How did we? He did it somehow....
By George, he had a key! He can get in
again.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Again? that man!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Ay can he! Again! When he likes!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Kit, I am afraid. O Kit, he will kill my
father.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Afraid. I&rsquo;m glad of that. Now, you&rsquo;ll see I&rsquo;m
worth my salt at something. Ten to one he&rsquo;s back
to Mrs. Drake&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ll after, and lay him aboard.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> O Kit, he is too strong for you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Arethusa, that&rsquo;s below the belt! Never you fear;
I&rsquo;ll give a good account of him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa</span> (<i>taking cutlass from wall</i>). You&rsquo;ll be none the
worse for this, dear.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> That&rsquo;s so (<i>making cuts</i>). All the same, I&rsquo;m half
ashamed to draw on a blind man; it&rsquo;s too much odds.
(<i>He leans suddenly against the table.</i>) Ah!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199"></a>199</span>
<span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Kit! are you ill?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> My head&rsquo;s like a humming top; it serves me right
for drinking.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Oh, and the blind man! (<i>She runs, L., to the
corner cupboard, brings a bottle and glass, and fills and
offers glass.</i>) Here, lad, drink that.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> To you! That&rsquo;s better. (<i>Bottle and glass remain
on <span class="sc">Gaunt&rsquo;s</span> table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Suppose you miss him?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Miss him! The road is straight; and I can hear
the tap-tapping of that stick a mile away.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa</span> (<i>listening</i>). &rsquo;St! my father stirring in his
room!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> Let me get clear; tell him why when I&rsquo;m gone.
The door&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Locked!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kit.</span> The window!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Quick, quick! (<i>She unfastens R. window,

<p class="ct"><i><span class="sc">Arethusa</span>, <span class="sc">Gaunt</span> entering L.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Father, Kit is gone.... He is asleep.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Waiting, waiting and wearying. The years, they
go so heavily, my Hester still waiting! (<i>He goes
R. to chest, which he opens.</i>) That is your chain; it&rsquo;s
of Guinea gold; I brought it you from Guinea. (<i>Taking
out chain.</i>) You liked it once; it pleased you long ago;
O, why not now&mdash;why will you not be happy now?...
I swear this is my last voyage; see, I lay my
hand upon the Holy Book and swear it. One more
venture&mdash;for the child&rsquo;s sake, Hester; you don&rsquo;t think
upon your little maid.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> Ah, for my sake, it was for my sake!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Ten days out from Lagos. That&rsquo;s a strange

sunset, Mr. Yeo. All hands shorten sail! Lay aloft
there, look smart!... What&rsquo;s that? Only the
negroes in the hold.... Mr. Yeo, she can&rsquo;t live
long at this; I have a wife and child in Barnstaple.... Christ,
what a sea! Hold on, for God&rsquo;s sake&mdash;hold
on fore and aft! Great God! (<i>as though the
sea were making a breach over the ship at the moment</i>).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> O!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> They seem quieter down below there....
No water&mdash;no light&mdash;no air&mdash;seven days battened down,
and the seas mountain high, and the ship labouring
hell-deep! Two hundred and five, two hundred
and five, two hundred and five&mdash;all to eternal
torture!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> O pity him, pity him! Let him sleep, let him
forget! Let her prayers avail in heaven, and let him
rest!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt.</span> Hester, no, don&rsquo;t smile at me. Rather tears!
I have seen you weep&mdash;often, often; two hundred
and five times. Two hundred and five! (<i>With ring.</i>)
Hester, here is your ring (<i>he tries to put the ring on his
finger</i>). How comes it in my hand? Not fallen off
again? O no, impossible! it was made smaller, dear,
it can&rsquo;t have fallen off! Ah, you waste away. You
must live, you must, for the dear child&rsquo;s sake, for mine,
Hester, for mine! Ah, the child. Yes. Who am I
to judge? Poor Kit French! And she, your little
maid, she&rsquo;s like you, Hester, and she will save him!
How should a man be saved without a wife?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arethusa.</span> O father, if you could but hear me thank and
bless you! (<i>The tapping of <span class="sc">Pew&rsquo;s</span> stick is heard
approaching. <span class="sc">Gaunt</span> passes L. front and sits.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gaunt</span> (<i>beginning to count the taps</i>). One&mdash;two&mdash;two

me on the road; and so you was hot foot after old
Pew? Christopher, my young friend, I reckon I&rsquo;ll
have the bowels out of that chest, and I reckon,
you&rsquo;ll be lagged and scragged for it. (<i>At these words
<span class="sc">Arethusa</span> locks the door, and takes the key.</i>) What&rsquo;s
that? All still. There&rsquo;s something wrong about this

brace up and carry on. Where&rsquo;s the tool? (<i>Producing
knife.</i>) Ah, here she is; and now for the chest;
and the gold; and rum&mdash;rum&mdash;rum. What! Open?...
old clothes, by God!... He&rsquo;s done me;
he&rsquo;s been before me; he&rsquo;s bolted with the swag; that&rsquo;s
why he ran: Lord wither and waste him forty year for
it! O Christopher, if I had my fingers on your throat!
Why didn&rsquo;t I strangle the soul out of him? I heard the
breath squeak in his weasand; and Jack Gaunt pulled
me off. Ah, Jack, that&rsquo;s another I owe you. My
pious friend, if I was God Almighty for five minutes!
(<i><span class="sc">Gaunt</span> rises and begins to pace the stage like a quarter-deck,
L.</i>) What&rsquo;s that? A man&rsquo;s walk. He don&rsquo;t

my bo. (<i>He gropes his way stealthily till he comes
to <span class="sc">Gaunt&rsquo;s</span> table, where he burns his hand in the candle.</i>)

God, doesn&rsquo;t he see me? It&rsquo;s the horrors come alive.

(<i>He gropes to the door, stopping and starting.</i>) Door.
(<i>His voice rising for the first time, sharp with terror.</i>)
Locked? Key gone? Trapped! Keep off&mdash;keep off

sweat. What devil&rsquo;s den is this? I must out&mdash;out!

commanding officer?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Charles.</span> Why, sir, we have quite an alert. Information
has been received from Lyons that the notorious
malefactor, Robert Macaire, has broken prison, and
the Brigadier is now scouring the country in his pursuit.
I myself am instructed to watch the visitors to our
house.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> That will do, Charles: you may go. (<i>Exit

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> Yes, yes. Charles, you know, Charles. Can
he marry? under these untoward and peculiar circumstances,
can he marry?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Notary.</span> Now, lemme tell you: marriage is a contract
to which there are two constracting parties. That
being clear, I am prepared to argue categorically that
your son Charles&mdash;who, it appears, is not your son
Charles&mdash;I am prepared to argue that one party to
a contract being null and void, the other party to a
contract cannot by law oblige or constrain the first
party to constract or bind himself to any contract,
except the other party be able to see his way clearly to
constract himself with him. I donno if I make myself
clear?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Notary.</span> Now, lemme tell you: by applying justice of
peace might possibly afford relief.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> But how?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Notary.</span> Ay, there&rsquo;s the rub.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> But what am I to do? He&rsquo;s not my son, I
tell you: Charles is not my son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page212"></a>212</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Notary.</span> I know.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Notary.</span> That&rsquo;s what I want. (<i>They go out, L.U.E.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Aline.</span> And now, if you&rsquo;ve done deranging my table,
to the cellar for the wine, the whole pack of you.
(<i>Manet sola, considering table.</i>) There! it&rsquo;s like a
garden. If I had as sweet a table for my wedding,
I would marry the Notary.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand</span> (<i>looking off L.C.</i>). Sold again!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> This is a favoured spot, Bertrand: ten minutes
from the frontier: ten minutes from escape. Blessings
on that frontier line! The criminal hops across,
and lo! the reputable man. (<i>Reading.</i>) &ldquo;&rsquo;Auberge
des Adrets,&rsquo; by John Paul Dumont.&rdquo; A table set for
company; this is fate: Bertrand, are we the first
arrivals? An office; a cabinet; a cash-box&mdash;aha!
and a cash-box, golden within. A money-box is like a
Quaker beauty: demure without, but what a figure of
a woman! Outside gallery: an architectural feature
I approve; I count it a convenience both for love
and war; the troubadour&mdash;twang-twang; the craftsmen&mdash;&mdash;
(<i>Makes as if turning key.</i>) The kitchen
window: humming with cookery; truffles, before
Jove! I was born for truffles. Cock your hat: meat,
wine, rest, and occupation; men to gull, women to
fool, and still the door open, the great unbolted door of
the frontier!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Macaire, I&rsquo;m hungry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213"></a>213</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Bertrand, excuse me, you are a sensualist. I
should have left you in the stone-yard at Lyons, and
written no passport but my own. Your soul is incorporate
with your stomach. Am I not hungry too?
My body, thanks to immortal Jupiter, is but the boy
that holds the kite-string; my aspirations and designs
swim like the kite sky-high, and overlook an empire.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> If I could get a full meal and a pound in my
pocket I would hold my tongue.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Dreams, dreams! We are what we are; and
what are we? Who are you? who cares? Who
am I? myself? What do we come from? an accident.
What&rsquo;s a mother? an old woman. A father? the
gentleman who beats her. What is crime? discovery.
Virtue? opportunity. Politics? a pretext. Affection?
an affectation. Morality? an affair of latitude.
Punishment? this side the frontier. Reward? the
other. Property? plunder. Business? other people&rsquo;s
money&mdash;not mine, by God! and the end of life to live
till we are hanged.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Macaire, I came into this place with my tail
between my legs already, and hungry besides; and
then you get to flourishing, and it depresses me worse
than the chaplain in the gaol.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> What is a chaplain? A man they pay to say
what you don&rsquo;t want to hear.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> And who are you after all? and what right
have you to talk like that? By what I can hear,
you&rsquo;ve been the best part of your life in quod; and
as for me, since I&rsquo;ve followed you, what sort of luck
have I had? Sold again! A boose, a blue fright,
two years&rsquo; hard, and the police hot-foot after us even
now.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> What is life? A boose and the police.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Of course, I know you&rsquo;re clever; I admire
you down to the ground, and I&rsquo;ll starve without
you. But I can&rsquo;t stand it, and I&rsquo;m off. Good-bye:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214"></a>214</span>
good luck to you, old man! and if you want the
bundle&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> I am a gentleman of a mild disposition, and,
I thank my Maker, elegant manners; but rather than
be betrayed by such a thing as you are, with the
courage of a hare, and the manners, by the Lord Harry,
of a jumping-jack&mdash;&mdash;(<i>He shows his knife.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Put it up, put it up: I&rsquo;ll do what you want.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> What is obedience? fear. So march straight,
or look for mischief. It&rsquo;s not <i>bon ton</i>, I know, and
far from friendly. But what is friendship? convenience.
But we lose time in this amiable dalliance.
Come, now, an effort of deportment: the head thrown
back, a jaunty carriage of the leg; crook gracefully the
elbow. Thus. &rsquo;Tis better. (<i>Calling.</i>) House, house
here!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Are you mad? We haven&rsquo;t a brass farthing.</p>

One word: a matter of detail; Charles is not my son.
(<i>All exclaim.</i>) O no, he is not my son. Perhaps I

<p><span class="sc">Charles.</span> I am not your son, sir?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> O no, far from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page218"></a>218</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> O, I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s an odd tale, a romantic
tale: it may amuse you. It was twenty years ago,
when I kept the &ldquo;Golden Head&rdquo; at Lyons; Charles
was left upon my doorstep in a covered basket, with
sufficient money to support the child till he should
come of age. There was no mark upon the linen,
nor any clue but one: an unsigned letter from the
father of the child, which he strictly charged me to
preserve. It was to prove his identity; he, of course,
would know the contents, and he only; so I keep it
safe in the third compartment of my cash-box, with
the ten thousand francs I&rsquo;ve saved for his dowry.
Here is the key; it&rsquo;s a patent key. To-day the poor
boy is twenty-one, to-morrow to be married. I did
perhaps hope the father would appear; there was a
Marquis coming; he wrote me for a room; I gave him
the best, Number Thirteen, which you have all heard
of; I did hope it might be he, for a Marquis, you know,
is always genteel. But no, you see. As for me, I take
all to witness I&rsquo;m as innocent of him as the babe
unborn.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Ahem! I think you said the linen bore an
M?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> Pardon me; the markings were cut off.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> True. The basket white, I think?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> Brown, brown.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Ah! brown&mdash;a whitey-brown.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Goriot.</span> I tell &rsquo;ee what, Dumont, this is all very well;
but in that case, I&rsquo;ll be danged if he gets my daater.
(<i>General consternation.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> O Goriot, let&rsquo;s have happy faces!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Goriot.</span> Happy faces be danged! I want to marry my
daater; I want your son. But who be this? I
don&rsquo;t know, and you don&rsquo;t know, and he don&rsquo;t know.
He may be anybody; by Jarge, he may be nobody!

traveller to interject one word? There sits the young
man, full, I am sure, of pleasing qualities; here the
young maiden, by her own confession bashfully consenting
to the match; there sits that dear old gentleman,
a lover of bright faces like myself, his own now
dimmed with sorrow; and here&mdash;(may I be allowed
to add?)&mdash;here sits this noble Roman, a father like
myself, and like myself the slave of duty. Last you

la Tonnerre de Brest, the man of the world and the
man of delicacy. I find you all&mdash;permit me the expression&mdash;gravelled.
A marriage and an obstacle. Now,
what is marriage? The union of two souls, and, what
is possibly more romantic, the fusion of two dowries.
What is an obstacle? the devil. And this obstacle?
to me, as a man of family, the obstacle seems grave;
but to me, as a man and a brother, what is it but a
word? O my friend (<i>to <span class="sc">Goriot</span></i>), you whom I single
out as the victim of the same noble failings with myself
of pride of birth, of pride of honesty&mdash;O my friend,
reflect. Go now apart with your dishevelled daughter,
your tearful son-in-law, and let their plaints constrain
you. Believe me, when you come to die, you will recall

downcast looks that you have not recognised the
true nature of your responsibility as citizens of time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222"></a>222</span>
What is care? impiety. Joy? the whole duty of
man. Here is an opportunity of duty it were sinful
to forego. With a word, I could lighten your hearts;
but I prefer to quicken your heels, and send you forth
on your ingenuous errand with happy faces and smiling
thoughts, the physicians of your own recovery. Fiddlers,
to your catgut! Up, Bertrand, and show them
how one foots it in society; forward, girls, and choose
me every one the lad she loves; Dumont, benign old
man, lead forth our blushing Curate; and you, O
bride, embrace the uniform of your beloved, and help
us dance in your wedding-day. (<i>Dance, in the course

<p class="ct"><i><span class="sc">Macaire</span>, <span class="sc">Bertrand</span>, who instantly takes a bottle from
the wedding-table, and sits with it, L.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Bertrand, there&rsquo;s a devil of a want of a father
here.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Ay, if we only knew where to find him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Bertrand, look at me: I am Macaire; I am
that father.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> You, Macaire?&mdash;you a father?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Not yet, but in five minutes. I am capable
of anything. (<i>Producing key.</i>) What think you of
this?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> That? Is it a key?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Ay, boy, and what besides? my diploma of
respectability, my patent of fatherhood. I prigged it&mdash;in
the ardour of the dance I prigged it; I change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223"></a>223</span>
it beyond recognition, thus (<i>twists the handle of the
key</i>); and now...? Where is my long-lost
child? produce my young policeman, show me my
gallant boy.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Dear innocence, how should you? Your brains
are in your fists. Go and keep watch. (<i>He goes into
the office and returns with the cash-box.</i>) Keep watch,
I say.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Where?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Everywhere. (<i>He opens box.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Gold.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Hands off! Keep watch. (<i><span class="sc">Bertrand</span> at back
of stage.</i>) Beat slower, my paternal heart! The third
compartment! let me see.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> S&rsquo;st! (<i><span class="sc">Macaire</span> shuts box.</i>) No: false alarm.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> The third compartment. Ay, here t&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> S&rsquo;st! (<i>Same business.</i>) No: fire away.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> The third compartment: it must be this.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> S&rsquo;st. (<i><span class="sc">Macaire</span> keeps box open, watching
<span class="sc">Bertrand</span>.</i>) All serene: it&rsquo;s the wind.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Now, see here! (<i>He darts his knife into the
stage.</i>) I will either be backed as a man should be,
or from this minute out I&rsquo;ll work alone. Do you
understand? I said alone.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> For the Lord&rsquo;s sake, Macaire!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

babble of the &rsquo;Change, the sailing from all

the doors of the bright theatre, the key of consciences,

itching fingers; and to set this by, turn a deaf ear upon
the siren present, and condescend once more, naked,
into the ring with fortune&mdash;Macaire, how few would
do it! But you, Macaire, you are compacted of more
subtile clay. No cheap immediate pilfering: no retail
trade of petty larceny; but swoop at the heart of the
position, and clutch all!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand</span> (<i>at his shoulder</i>). Halves!</p>

<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<p class="ct"><span class="sc">Macaire, Bertrand</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Bertrand, I am content: a child might play
with me. Does your pipe draw well?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Like a factory chimney. This is my notion
of life: liquor, a chair, a table to put my feet on, a
fine clean pipe, and no police.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Bertrand, do you see these changing exhalations
do you see these blue rings and spirals, weaving
their dance, like a round of fairies, on the footless air?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> I see &rsquo;em right enough.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Man of little vision, expound me these meteors!
What do they signify, O wooden-head? Clod, of what
do they consist?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Damned bad tobacco.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> I will give you a little course of science. Everything,
Bertrand (much as it may surprise you), has three
states: a vapour, a liquid, a solid. These are fortune
in the vapour: these are ideas. What are ideas? the
protoplasm of wealth. To your head&mdash;which, by the
way, is solid, Bertrand&mdash;what are they but foul air?
To mine, to my prehensile and constructive intellects,
see, as I grasp and work them, to what lineaments of the
future they transform themselves: a palace, a barouche,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226"></a>226</span>
a pair of luminous footmen, plate, wine, respect, and
to be honest!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> But what&rsquo;s the sense in honesty?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> The sense? You see me: Macaire: elegant,
immoral, invincible in cunning; well, Bertrand, much
as it may surprise you, I am simply damned by my
dishonesty.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> No!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> The honest man, Bertrand, that&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s noblest
work. He carries the bag, my boy. Would you have
me define honesty? the strategic point for theft.
Bertrand, if I&rsquo;d three hundred a year, I&rsquo;d be honest
to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Ah! don&rsquo;t you wish you may get it!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Bertrand, I will bet you my head against your
own&mdash;the longest odds I can imagine&mdash;that with
honesty for my spring-board, I leap through history
like a paper hoop, and come out among posterity
heroic and immortal.</p>

the change? Hear me, then, and you (<i>to the others</i>)

your second father waits to welcome you. (<i>Business.</i>)
Goriot, noble old man, I grasp your hand. (<i>He doesn&rsquo;t.</i>)
And you, Dumont, how shall your unknown benefactor
thank you for your kindness to his boy? (<i>A dead
pause.</i>) Charles, to my arms!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Charles.</span> My father, you are still something of a stranger.
I hope&mdash;er&mdash;in the course of time&mdash;I hope that may
be somewhat mended. But I confess that I have so
long regarded Mr. Dumont&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Love him still, dear boy, love him still. I
have not returned to be a burden on your heart, nor
much, comparatively, on your pocket. A place by the
fire, dear boy, a crust for my friend, Bertrand. (<i>A
dead pause.</i>) Ah, well, this is a different home-coming
from that I fancied when I left the letter: I dreamed
to grow rich. Charles, you remind me of your sainted
mother.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Charles.</span> I trust, sir, you do not think yourself less welcome
for your poverty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page228"></a>228</span>
<span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Nay, nay&mdash;more welcome, more welcome. O,
I know your&mdash;(<i>business</i>) backs! Besides, my poverty
is noble. Political.... Dumont, what are your
politics?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> A plain old republican, my lord.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> And yours, my good Goriot?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Goriot.</span> I be a royalist, I be, and so be my daater.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> How strange is the coincidence! The party
that I sought to found combined the peculiarities of
both; a patriotic enterprise in which I fell. This
humble fellow ... have I introduced him? You
behold in us the embodiment of aristocracy and democracy.
Bertrand, shake hands with my family.
(<i><span class="sc">Bertrand</span> is rebuffed by one and the other in dead

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Sold again!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Charles, to my arms! (<i>Business.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ernestine.</span> Well, but now that he has a father of some
kind, cannot the marriage go on?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Angel, this very night: I burn to take my
grandchild on my knees.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Goriot.</span> Be you that young man&rsquo;s veyther?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Ay, and what a father!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Goriot.</span> Then all I&rsquo;ve got to say is, I shan&rsquo;t and I wun&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Ah, friends, friends, what a satisfaction it is,

<p><span class="sc">Marcaire.</span> Marquis, delighted, I am sure.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marquis.</span> Well, sir?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire</span> (<i>touching him on the breast</i>). You have there
thirty thousand francs.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marquis.</span> Well, sir?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> I was but thinking of the inequalities of life,
my lord: that I, who, for all you know, may be the
father of your son, should have nothing; and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231"></a>231</span>
you, who, for all I know, may be the father of mine,
should be literally bulging with bank notes....
Where do you keep them at night?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marquis.</span> Under my pillow. I think it rather ingenious.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Admirably so. I applaud the device.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marquis.</span> Well, sir?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Do you snuff, my lord?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marquis.</span> No, sir, I do not.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> My lord, I am a poor man.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marquis.</span> Well, sir? and what of that?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> The affections, my lord, are priceless. Money
will not buy them; or, at least, it takes a great deal.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marquis.</span> Sir, your sentiments do you honour.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> My lord, you are rich.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marquis.</span> Well, sir?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Now follow me, I beseech you. Here am I,
my lord; and there, if I may so express myself, are
you. Each has a father&rsquo;s heart, and there we are
equal; each claims yon interesting lad, and there
again we are on a par. But, my lord&mdash;and here we
come to the inequality, and what I consider the unfairness
of the thing&mdash;you have thirty thousand francs,
and I, my lord, have not a rap. You mark me! not
a rap, my lord! My lord, put yourself in my position;
consider what must be my feelings, my desires; and&mdash;hey?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marquis.</span> I fail to grasp....</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire</span> (<i>with irritation</i>). My dear man, there is the
door of the house; here am I; there (<i>touching <span class="sc">Marquis</span>
on the breast</i>) are thirty thousand francs. Well, now?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marquis.</span> I give you my word of honour, sir, I gather
nothing; my mind is quite unused to such prolonged
exertion. If the boy be yours, he is not mine; if he
be mine, he is not yours; and if he is neither of ours,
or both of ours ... in short, my mind....</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> My lord, will you lay those thirty thousand
francs upon the table?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page232"></a>232</span>
<span class="sc">Marquis.</span> I fail to grasp ... but if it will in any way
oblige you.... (<i>Does so.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marcaire.</span> Now, my lord, follow me: I take them up;
you see? I put them in my pocket; you follow
me? This is my hat; here is my stick; and here is
my&mdash;my friend&rsquo;s bundle.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marquis.</span> But that is my cloak.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marcaire.</span> Precisely. Now, my lord, one more effort
of your lordship&rsquo;s mind. If I were to go out of that
door, with the full intention&mdash;follow me close&mdash;the
full intention of never being heard of more, what
would you do?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marquis.</span> I!&mdash;send for the police.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marcaire.</span> Take your money! (<i>Dashing down the notes.</i>)
Man, if I met you in a lane! (<i>He drops his head upon
the table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marquis.</span> The poor soul is insane. The other man,
whom I suppose to be his keeper, is very much to
blame.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marcaire</span> (<i>raising his head</i>). I have a light! (<i>To <span class="sc">Marquis</span>.</i>)
With invincible oafishness, my lord, I cannot
struggle. I pass you by; I leave you gaping by the
wayside; I blush to have a share in the progeny of

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marcaire.</span> Bitten!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Sold again!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marcaire.</span> Had he the wit of a lucifer-match! But what
can gods or men against stupidity? Still, I have a
trick. Where is that damned old man?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page233"></a>233</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont</span> (<i>entering</i>). I hear you want me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marcaire.</span> Ah, my good old Dumont, this is very sad.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> Dear me, what is wrong?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marcaire.</span> Dumont, you had a dowry for my son?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> I had; I have: ten thousand francs.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marcaire.</span> It&rsquo;s a poor thing, but it must do. Dumont,
I bury my old hopes, my old paternal tenderness.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> What? is he not your son?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marcaire.</span> Pardon me, my friend. The Marquis claims
my boy. I will not seek to deny that he attempted
to corrupt me, or that I spurned his gold. It was
thirty thousand.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> Noble soul!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marcaire.</span> One has a heart.... He spoke, Dumont,
that proud noble spoke, of the advantages to our
beloved Charles; and in my father&rsquo;s heart a voice
arose, louder than thunder. Dumont, was I unselfish?
The voice said no; the voice, Dumont, up and told me
to begone.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> To begone? to go?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marcaire.</span> To begone, Dumont, and to go. Both, Dumont.
To leave my son to marry, and be rich and happy as
the son of another; to creep forth myself, old, penniless,
broken-hearted, exposed to the inclemencies of
heaven and the rebuffs of the police.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> This is what I had looked for at your hands.
Noble, noble man!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marcaire.</span> One has a heart ... and yet, Dumont, it
can hardly have escaped your penetration that if I
were to shift from this hostelry without a farthing
and leave my offspring to wallow&mdash;literally&mdash;among
millions, I should play the part of little better than
an ass.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> But I had thought ... I had fancied....</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marcaire.</span> No, Dumont, you had not; do not seek to
impose upon my simplicity. What you did think
was this, Dumont: for the sake of this noble father,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"></a>234</span>
for the sake of this son whom he denies for his own
interest&mdash;I mean, for his interest&mdash;no, I mean, for his
own&mdash;well, anyway, in order to keep up the general
atmosphere of sacrifice and nobility, I must hand over
this dowry to the Baron Henri-Frédéric de Latour de
Main de la Tonnerre de Brest.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> That? That&rsquo;s yours. I saw it drop.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> I give you my word of honour I heard it fall

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> But I saw it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Impossible. It must be yours.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> O, that explains. Now, all we have to do is to

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Distinctly.</p>

Providence, and you talk religion. Die? Why,
that is what man is made for; we are full of mortal
parts; we are all as good as dead already, we hang

made it&mdash;the aggregated egotism called society;

money? Have I none&mdash;great powers, none? Well,

<p><span class="sc">Macaire</span> (<i>calling off</i>). S&rsquo;st!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand</span> (<i>entering L.U.E.</i>). It&rsquo;s creeping dark.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Blinding dark; and a good job.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Macaire, I&rsquo;m cold; my very hair&rsquo;s cold.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Work, work will warm you: to your keys.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> No, Macaire, it&rsquo;s a horror. You&rsquo;ll not kill
him; let&rsquo;s have no bloodshed.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> None: it spoils your clothes. Now, see: you
have keys and you have experience: up that stair
and pick me the lock of that man&rsquo;s door. Pick me the
lock of that man&rsquo;s door.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> May I take the light?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> You may not. Go. (<i><span class="sc">Bertrand</span> mounts the
stairs and is seen picking the lock of Number Thirteen.</i>)
The earth spins eastward, and the day is at the door.
Yet half an hour of covert, and the sun will be afoot,
the discoverer, the great policeman. Yet half an hour
of night, the good, hiding, practicable night; and lo!
at a touch the gas-jet of the universe turned on; and
up with the sun gets the providence of honest people,
puts off his nightcap, throws up his window, stares
out of house&mdash;and the rogue must skulk again till dusk.
Yet half an hour and, Macaire, you shall be safe and
rich. If yon fool&mdash;my fool&mdash;would but miscarry, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239"></a>239</span>
the dolt within would hear and leap upon him, I could
intervene, kill both, by heaven&mdash;both!&mdash;cry murder
with the best, and at one stroke reap honour and gold.
For, Bertrand dead&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand</span> (<i>from above</i>). S&rsquo;st, Macaire.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Is it done, dear boy? Come down. (<i><span class="sc">Bertrand</span>
descends.</i>) Sit down beside this light: this
is your ring of safety, budge not beyond&mdash;the night
is crowded with hobgoblins. See ghosts and tremble
like a jelly if you must; but remember men are my
concern; and at the creak of a man&rsquo;s foot, hist!
(<i>Sharpening his knife upon his sleeve.</i>) What is a knife?
A plain man&rsquo;s sword.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Not the knife, Macaire; O, not the knife.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> My name is Self-Defence. (<i>He goes upstairs
and enters Number Thirteen.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> He&rsquo;s in. I hear a board creak. What a
night, what a night! Will he hear him? O Lord,
my poor Macaire! I hear nothing, nothing. The
night&rsquo;s as empty as a dream: he must hear him; he
cannot help but hear him; and then&mdash;O Macaire,
Macaire, come back to me. It&rsquo;s death, and it&rsquo;s death,
and it&rsquo;s death. Red, red: a corpse. Macaire to
kill, Macaire to die? I&rsquo;d rather starve, I&rsquo;d rather
perish, than either: I&rsquo;m not fit, I&rsquo;m not fit for either!
Why, how&rsquo;s this? I want to cry. (<i>A stroke, and
a groan from above.</i>) God Almighty, one of them&rsquo;s
gone! (<i>He falls with his head on table, R. <span class="sc">Macaire</span>
appears at the top of the stairs, descends, comes airily
forward and touches him on the shoulder. <span class="sc">Bertrand</span>,

I thought I had lost him. (<i>Day breaking.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> The contrary, dear boy. (<i>He produces notes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> What was it like?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Like? Nothing. A little blood, a dead man.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Blood!... Dead! (<i>He falls at table
sobbing. <span class="sc">Macaire</span> divides the notes into two parts;</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240"></a>240</span>
<i>on the smaller he wipes the bloody knife, and folding the
stains inward, thrusts the notes into <span class="sc">Bertrand&rsquo;s</span> face.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> What is life without the pleasures of the table?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand</span> (<i>taking and pocketing notes</i>). Macaire, I can&rsquo;t
get over it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> My mark is the frontier, and at top speed.
Don&rsquo;t hang your jaw at me. Up, up, at the double;
pick me that cash-box; and let&rsquo;s get the damned
house fairly cleared.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> I can&rsquo;t. Did he bleed much?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Bleed? Must I bleed you? To work, or I&rsquo;m
dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> It&rsquo;s all right, Macaire; I&rsquo;m going.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Better so: an old friend is nearly sacred. (<i>Full
daylight: lights up. <span class="sc">Macaire</span> blows out lantern.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Where&rsquo;s the key?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Key? I tell you to pick it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand</span> (<i>with the box</i>). But it&rsquo;s a patent lock. Where
is the key? You had it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Will you pick that lock?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> I can&rsquo;t; it&rsquo;s a patent. Where&rsquo;s the key?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> If you will have it, I put it back in that old

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> My dear sir, what is duty? duty is my eye.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier</span> (<i>solemnly</i>). And Betty Martin. (<i><span class="sc">Gendarmes</span>
sit at table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire</span> (<i>to <span class="sc">Bertrand</span></i>). Dear friend, sit down.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand</span> (<i>sitting down</i>). O Lord!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier</span> (<i>to <span class="sc">Macaire</span></i>). You seem to be a gentleman of
considerable intelligence.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> I fear, sir, you flatter. One has lived, one has
loved, and one remembers: that is all. One&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lives
of Celebrated Criminals&rdquo; has met with a certain success,
and one is ever in quest of fresh material.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> By the way, a singular thing about my patent key.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> This gentleman is speaking.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Excellent Dumont! he means no harm. This
Macaire is not personally known to you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> Are you connected with justice?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Ah, sir, justice is a point above a poor author.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier</span> (<i>with glass</i>). Justice is the very devil.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> My dear sir, my friend and I, I regret to say,
have an appointment in Lyons, or I could spend my
life in this society. Charge your glasses: one hour
to madness and to joy! What is to-morrow? the
enemy of to-day. Wine? the bath of life. One
moment: I find I have forgotten my watch. (<i>He
makes for the door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> Halt!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Sir, what is this jest?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> Sentry at the door. Your passports.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> My good man, with all the pleasure in life.
(<i>Gives papers. The <span class="sc">Brigadier</span> puts on spectacles
and examines them.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page244"></a>244</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand</span> (<i>rising and passing round to <span class="sc">Macaire&rsquo;s</span> other
side</i>). It&rsquo;s life and death: they must soon find it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire</span> (<i>aside</i>). Don&rsquo;t I know? My heart&rsquo;s like fire in
my body.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> Your name is?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> It is; one&rsquo;s name is not unknown.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> Justice exacts your name.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Henri-Frédéric de Latour de Main de la Tonnerre
de Brest.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> Your profession?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> No, but what is your trade?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> I am an analytical chemist.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> Justice is inscrutable. Your papers are in
order. (<i>To <span class="sc">Bertrand</span>.</i>) Now, sir, and yours?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> I feel kind of ill.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Bertrand, this gentleman addresses you. He
is not one of us; in other scenes, in the gay and giddy
world of fashion, one is his superior. But to-day he
represents the majesty of law; and as a citizen it is
one&rsquo;s pride to do him honour.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> Those are my sentiments.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> I beg your pardon, I&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Gives papers.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> Your name?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Napoleon.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> What? In your passport it is written
Bertrand.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> It&rsquo;s this way: I was born Bertrand, and
then I took the name of Napoleon, and I mostly always
call myself either Napoleon or Bertrand.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> The truth is always best. Your profession?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> I am an orphan.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> What the devil! (<i>To <span class="sc">Macaire</span>.</i>) Is your
friend an idiot?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Pardon me, he is a poet.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> Poetry is a great hindrance to the ends of
justice. Well, take your papers.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Then we may go?</p>

<h4>SCENE IV</h4>

<p><i>To these, <span class="sc">Charles</span>, who is seen on the gallery going to the

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> One glass more. (<i><span class="sc">Bertrand</span> touches <span class="sc">Macaire</span>,
and points to <span class="sc">Charles</span>, who enters Number Thirteen.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> No more, no more, no more.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier</span> (<i>rising and taking <span class="sc">Macaire</span> by the arm</i>). I
stipulate.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Engagement in Turin!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> Turin?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Lyons, Lyons!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> For God&rsquo;s sake ...</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> Well, good-bye!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Good-bye, good&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Charles</span> (<i>from within</i>). Murder! Help! (<i>Appearing.</i>)
Help here! The Marquis is murdered.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> Stand to the door. A man up there. (<i>A
<span class="sc">Gendarme</span> hurries up staircase into Number Thirteen,
<span class="sc">Charles</span> following him. Enter on both sides of gallery
the remaining characters of the piece, except the <span class="sc">Notary</span>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier</span> (<i>to <span class="sc">Dumont</span></i>). John Paul Dumont, I arrest
you.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> Do your duty, officer. I can answer for myself
and my own people.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> Yes, but these strangers?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dumont.</span> They are strangers to me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> I am an honest man: I stand upon my rights:
search me; or search this person, of whom I know too
little. (<i>Smiting his brow.</i>) By heaven, I see it all!
This morning&mdash;&mdash;(<i>To <span class="sc">Bertrand.</span></i>) How, sir, did you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246"></a>246</span>
dare to flaunt your booty in my very face? (<i>To <span class="sc">Brigadier.</span></i>)
He showed me notes; he was up ere day;
search him, and you&rsquo;ll find. There stands the murderer.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> O, Macaire! (<i>He is seized and searched and
the notes are found.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brigadier.</span> There is blood upon the notes. Handcuffs.
(<i><span class="sc">Macaire</span> edging towards the door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Macaire, you may as well take the bundle.
(<i><span class="sc">Macaire</span> is stopped by sentry, and comes front, R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Charles</span> (<i>re-appearing</i>). Stop, I know the truth. (<i>He
comes down.</i>) Brigadier, my father is not dead. He
is not even dangerously hurt. He has spoken. There
is the would-be assassin.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Hell! (<i>He darts across to the staircase, and
turns on the second step, flashing out the knife.</i>) Back,
hounds! (<i>He springs up the stair, and confronts
them from the top.</i>) Fools, I am Robert Macaire!
(<i>As <span class="sc">Macaire</span> turns to flee, he is met by the Gendarme
coming out of Number Thirteen; he stands an instant
checked, is shot from the stage, and falls headlong backward
down the stair. <span class="sc">Bertrand</span>, with a cry, breaks
from the Gendarmes, kneels at his side, and raises his
head.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bertrand.</span> Macaire, Macaire, forgive me. I didn&rsquo;t blab;
you know I didn&rsquo;t blab.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Macaire.</span> Sold again, old boy. Sold for the last time;
at least, the last time this side death. Death&mdash;&mdash;what
is death? (<i>He dies.</i>)</p>
